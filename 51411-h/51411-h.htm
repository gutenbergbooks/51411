<h2>CHAPTER I<br /><span class="mediumfont">THE SITUATION AFTER LEMBERG</span></h2>


<p>The capture of the important town of
Lemberg, the capital of Galicia, by the
forces of the Tsar during the first week
of September may be said to have marked
an epoch in the operations of the gigantic
armies contending for the mastery in
what had come to be popularly known
as the Eastern Theatre of operations in
the world-war. It was a very solid advantage,
and one which gained for the
Russian Army a substantial foothold
upon Austrian territory. The struggle
of the nations had endured for some
weeks, and the victory of Lemberg was
all the more welcome and popular because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
it happened at a time when our
Russian Allies needed a really heartening
and enlivening success. For it would be
absurd to say that the so-called “Russian
steam-roller” had moved on from triumph
to crushing triumph with that irresistible
impulse which the arm-chair critics had
so comfortably predicted for it. Indeed,
after the threat to Danzig itself implied
in General Rennenkampf’s brilliant raid
into Eastern Prussia, and his victory over
the army of General von Hindenburg in
the first decisive engagement of the war
at Gumbinnen, the rushing back of masses
of German troops from the western to
the eastern theatre of operations had
completely changed the situation. By
admirable generalship, too, Von Hindenburg
had turned the tables on his foe,
and had inflicted a signal defeat on the
invaders of East Prussia at Tannenberg.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>From this point, then, the Russians
became for the moment no longer an
attacking force. If they had inflicted,
they had also suffered, immense losses.
General Rennenkampf’s brisk offensive
through East Prussia had been definitively
checked, and it behoved the
Tsar’s military advisers to find, and find
speedily, what the American soldier-critic
described as “another way round.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Austrians had projected
an invasion of Russian Poland which,
successful in its initial stages, led up to
a succession of disastrous reverses. A
co-operating German force under General
Preuske fared also very well for a while,
its advance into Western Poland causing
the abandonment of the important town
of Lodz. But it speedily became evident
that in General Russky, commander of
the army designated to checkmate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
invasion, Russia possessed a leader of
conspicuous ability. The Germans were
pressed back towards the Polish frontier,
while the Austrians, upon whom the
heaviest stress of this fighting fell, presently
came in for a series of reverses.
Thus, in what is known as the battle of
Przemysl, the Austrian General Bankal
was killed and five thousand prisoners
captured. Then, in a further battle or
series of conflicts lasting an entire week
(August to September), Lemberg fell into
Russian hands, and the Petrograd bulletins
claimed upwards of sixty thousand
Austrian prisoners and 637 guns. It is
from this point that I take up the as
yet rather obscure story of this fluctuating
campaign, first premising that the
extraordinary severity of the Russian
censorship of news renders the task no
light one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>While, during the first half of September,
General Russky is gathering up the
fruits of his victory of Lemberg pending
a resumption of his successful advance
through Galicia, we may be permitted
to take a brief glance at the personalities
of the men on whom the Grand-duke
Nicholas, Russia’s Imperial Commander-in-Chief,
could principally depend. In
the recent words of a high military
authority: “There are, and always have
been, brilliant soldiers in the upper
grades of the Russian Army. At the
beginning of the Great War Russia possessed
three leaders of high reputation&mdash;Rennenkampf,
a cavalry general, and the
commander of one of the subsidiary
armies under Kuropatkin in the Japanese
War; Samsonoff, who had also fought
in the Far East, and had the reputation
of a first-class military organiser; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Russky, a scientific soldier, with a good
record as a teacher of the art of war in
the Russian Staff College. All three were
among the commanders sent to the
western frontier.”</p>

<p>And what of their not less brilliant
opponent, General von Hindenburg, popularly
known in Germany to-day as “the
Saviour of East Prussia”? This distinguished
officer&mdash;who celebrated his
sixty-seventh birthday shortly after his
victory of Tannenberg, when quantities
of “love-offerings” reached him from
Berlin, where a street has already been
named after him&mdash;was promptly promoted
from the command in Eastern
Prussia to that of the field-armies operating
in Poland, and was made a Freeman
of three great German cities. Here is a
characteristic pæan of praise taken from
one of Berlin’s leading journals:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not in contemplative peace and snug
homeliness, as is appropriate to the birthday
of a general, of his own early morning
coffee, but outside in the iron field of the
new battles, which thunder and lightning
between the Vistula and the Dniester will
Hindenburg, Germany’s brilliant champion,
celebrate his sixty-seventh birthday.
And from Königsberg to Strassburg,
from Cologne and Aix to Breslau and
Przemysl, from the North Sea to the
Adriatic, all Germans and all dwellers in
the Habsburg lands whom Hindenburg
now approaches in the guise of a helper
will greet the day with a heartfelt joy.”</p>

<p>In following the record of the operations
it must be borne in mind that the
huge Russian land-frontier of some fifteen
hundred miles towards Austria and Germany
is for the most part the frontier
of Russian Poland. This province, in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
relation to the bulk of the Russian territory,
has been picturesquely likened to “a
huge bastion” wedged between German
territory to north and west and Austrian
territory to the south. But it is a
political rather than a natural frontier,
“marked out in somewhat arbitrary
fashion when, after the turmoil of the
Napoleonic wars, the map of Europe was
being resettled at the Congress of
Vienna.” One may say roughly that
this mass of Russian Poland projects
between German and Austrian territories
for about two hundred miles from north
to south and two hundred and fifty miles
from east to west. Russia has a group
of fortresses in the plain of Poland, three
of which are sometimes known as “the
Polish Triangle,” with a fourth fortress
acting as a sort of outpost or “triangle”
looking towards the German frontier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Warsaw (one of the world’s greatest
fortresses), Ivangorod, and Brest-Litovski
are these three places of strength constituting
a “triangle,” the outpost fortress
being Novo Georgievsk, at the
confluence of the Vistula and Narev
rivers. Then, along the latter river and
the Niemen runs a chain of fortified river-crossings,
supplying “a defence line for
the region north of the Pripet marshes,
and a well-protected concentration line
for armies destined to operate against
East Prussia.” Finally, this well-planned
fortress system is completed by a group
of fortified towns between the marsh
country and Galicia. It was the effective
“screen” of this system of strong
places that enabled the mobilisation of
the Tsar’s vast armies to be carried out
so successfully.</p>

<p>With regard to the natural configuration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of the wild and mostly desolate
country constituting the wide area of the
battle-ground, a few words of explanation
will be useful. There is little high
ground until one comes to the southern
border of the great Polish plain, where the
Carpathian range forms a natural rampart.
To the north the ground falls
away rapidly to the plain. There are
numerous rivers and streams, and great
tracts of forest-clad land. Eastward of
the Upper Vistula a low rise of ground
runs first northerly and then trends to
the north-east, forming “the water-parting”
between the rivers that flow
to the Baltic and the Black Sea. Still
eastward of this we come to the Marshes
of Pripet, or Pinsk, to which I have
already referred. Imagine to yourself
some thirty thousand square miles of
stream, pool, and swamp, by its very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
character utterly unsuited to the marching
or fighting operations of a great army.
In the northern region of the plain we
find, between the Vistula, the Narev,
and the Baltic Sea more wide-extended
tracts of swamp-covered forest land,
pools, lakes, and little rivers. Altogether,
it is one of the worst countries, physically
speaking, for the transport, much less the
manœuvring, of masses of men, horses,
and heavy artillery.</p>

<p>This historic battle-ground was once
the old kingdom of Poland, the scene of
some of the greatest political and military
crimes and blunders of past ages.
“Across the plain,” writes the military
critic whom I have already quoted,
“winds the broad, sluggish stream of the
Vistula. The great river is to this eastern
land what the Rhine is to Western
Europe.... On its banks, in the midst<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the plain, stands Warsaw, the old
capital of Poland and now the political,
military, and business centre of the
Russian province. There is only one
other large town in Russian Poland&mdash;Lodz,
not long ago a country village, now
a busy industrial centre. This paucity
of large towns is characteristic, not only
of Russian Poland but of the whole
Empire. The last census shows that in
European Russia there are only twenty-four
places that claim a population of
over a hundred thousand. Russia is a
country of agricultural villages. There
are more than 150,000 of them between
the Vistula and the Ural! The plain of
the Vistula is not an absolute dead level,
but there is nothing that can be called a
hill. There are wide stretches of woodland,
the refuge of the insurgent bands
in the Polish risings of 1830 and 1863.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Between the woods are open lands with
many villages, rich lands with a deep soil
somewhat primitively tilled.” So much
for the appointed battle-ground and the
“lie of the land.”</p>

<p>The victors of Lemberg did not long
rest on their laurels. An order of the
Day, promulgated by the Grand-duke
Nicholas and phrased with all that regard
for the cherished Slav ideals and
traditions which has helped to make this
war so popular in Russia, complimented
General Russky and the gallant army
under his orders. Another Order, addressed
by the Grand-duke to the <i lang="sk" xml:lang="sk">Sokols</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
the Polish bands of partisans organised
in Galicia, sternly admonished them for
the use in warfare of dum-dum bullets,
and informed them that in future they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
would be liable to be treated rather as
malefactors than as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bona fide</i> combatants
according to the usages of war.</p>

<p>The Tsar and Tsaritsa set a fine
example by spending much of their time
in visiting the hospitals and devising
helpful schemes for the amelioration of
the sufferings of the thousands of sick
and wounded. Of the conduct of the
military operations as a whole, the correspondent
of a New York journal wrote
home that “the Russians evidently have
their heart in their work. They have
profited greatly by the lessons of their
operations in Manchuria, both as regards
strategy and tactics. Every day in the
field increases their efficiency, and will
perfect the co-ordination between their
invading bodies.”</p>

<p>By a coincidence as dramatic as it
must have been intensely interesting, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
announcement in Petrograd of the brilliant
victory of Lemberg synchronised
with the Feast Day of Saint Alexander
Nevsky, Russia’s wonderful hero of the
thirteenth century, who was also the first
to beat back a Teutonic invasion of his
country. Only on the previous evening,
in fact, the people kneeling before the
shrines in the churches had prayed to this
saint: “O Alexander the Blessed, come
to the aid of your kindred and give us
victory over our enemies.” And when,
on the following day, the victory was
celebrated with that impressive ritual
which the Greek Church knows so well
how to employ, doubtless many among
the Slavs saw an immediate answer to
their prayers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br /><span class="mediumfont">THE AUSTRIAN DEBACLE: FROM LEMBERG
TO JAROSLAV</span></h2>


<p>We shall now proceed to follow the fortunes
of the Russo-Austrian campaign
immediately after the capture of Lemberg
in the early days of September.
Such a substantial success naturally put
the Russians in good heart. Rewards
were judiciously distributed on the recommendation
of the Grand-duke Nicholas,
Generals Russky and Brussiloff each
receiving that most coveted of decorations,
the Cross of St. George. It was
likewise officially notified that between
August 17 and September 3, a period of
rather more than a fortnight, the Tsar’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
forces operating against the Austrian
host of General von Auffenburg had
advanced no less a distance than 220
versts, or roughly 150 miles. During
the same period there had been practically
no lull in the fighting, which for
sheer sustained fury would appear to
have been little less sanguinary than that
between the German and Franco-British
armies in the West.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite>, in an editorial setting forth
the general situation of affairs after some
five weeks of war, called attention to the
influence being slowly but none the less
surely exercised by the Russian field-armies.
After pointing out that the
crisis of a great war had worked wonders
in the way of a more perfect understanding
between the Russian and British
peoples, the writer went on to say:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“The extraordinary prowess of the
Russian Army has already begun to
draw the ordinary Briton out of his
absorption in the military situation in
France, and to keep him in mind of the
fact that the arena of this war is not
any one country, but the Continent of
Europe. He realises more fully than
before that every blow struck at the
Central European Powers on their eastern
frontier is, in the long run, as telling as
any reverse inflicted upon them in the
western theatre of war. But he ought to
realise it more fully yet. The position is
that the long series of Russian successes,
culminating in the Austrian overthrow at
Lemberg and Halicz, has cast the whole
Austro-German war-plan into confusion,
which may at this moment be affecting
the German operations in France in the
most serious degree. The main Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Army in Southern Poland is now being
attacked with unsparing energy. Its
situation is rendered desperate by the
destruction of the Second Army at
Lemberg, which lays open its right
wing to assault by the victorious troops
of General Russky. Should the great
battle now raging end in another such
defeat as has already been inflicted there
will be nothing remaining in the field
that can stay the Russian march to
Berlin. The rapidity of the Russian
mobilisation and of the movement of the
Russian forces to the attack is one of
the several absolutely vital things with
which Germany did not reckon. The
brilliancy of their performance in the
field has surprised the enemy no less.
Deeply involved as Germany is in the
French campaign, dares she provide the
heavy and immediate reinforcements for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
which her Ally is clamouring? Dares
she, on the other hand, refuse them?
That is, put simply, the fatal dilemma
on the horns of which the monstrous
ambition of German militarism is like to
perish.”</p>

<p>If this last pertinent question was not
destined to be immediately answered,
the military situation now began to be
one of increasing menace for the Austro-German
Allies. In war one is bound to
get a vast amount of “claim and counterclaim”
on the part of the contending
nations. On September 6 the Tsar’s
Government took the step of publicly
characterising as “wilful falsehoods”
certain Austrian and German official
reports of recent successes. It was
claimed, in disproof of these statements,
that in the region between the rivers
Vistula and Bug the Russians had, up to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and including September 4, captured
many Austrian guns, 150 officers, and
12,000 men. It was added that, “having
broken the Austrian resistance,” the
Tsar’s army was already continuing
its victorious advance southwards from
Lemberg.</p>

<p>The Grand-duke and General Russky
had determined that no rest must be
given to the enemy’s army already so
badly beaten in front of the capital of
Galicia. Scouting far to the flank, the
Cossack cavalry already found themselves
in the passes of the Carpathians.
A German division intended to stiffen
the Austrian resistance along this extended
line was understood to have been
badly cut up on the left bank of the
Vistula; but details of the affair were
vague. To the west of Krasnostaw, however,
a whole Austrian battalion&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
45th of the line&mdash;was cut off and surrounded,
being compelled to surrender
to the number of 1,500 men and nearly
50 officers.</p>

<p>The next Russian objective would
obviously be the important and strongly
fortified town of Przemysl, fifty-five miles
west of Lemberg. But, before attacking
this strong place of arms, it was essential
to get possession of Mikolaiev. This
point owes its strategical importance to
the circumstance that it is situated at
the junction of the railways to Lemberg,
Jimacheff, and (via Stry) to the
Carpathians. Entrenchments had been
thrown up on both banks of the Dniester
for the protection of the bridges crossing
that river. With a mixed population of
Poles and Jews of a little over 4,000, it
had a garrison of some 10,000 men.
Moreover, it was common knowledge that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the Austrian authorities did not believe
in the practicability of Mikolaiev being
reduced either by investment or direct
assault, owing to the deep marshes that
surround the place for many miles. But,
alas! a similar impregnability has been
claimed for only too many of the fortresses
involved in this war, which have
held out for no longer than a few days.
Mikolaiev was to prove no exception to
the rule, although we are told that the
fortress’s guns were mounted in “armoured
cupolas.”</p>

<p>Apparently the place surrendered at
discretion after a very moderate resistance.
The garrison, forty heavy guns,
and a great quantity of ammunition
became the prizes of the victors; but
the details of what must have been a
brilliant feat of arms are conspicuously
meagre. It is stated, however, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
defences included triple lines of barbed
wire “and other obstacles.”</p>

<p>We have now the spectacle of two
separate Austrian armies, that of Galicia
and that which was operating in Southern
Poland, striving desperately to stem the
tide that appeared to be setting dead
against them.</p>

<p>By the second week of September
public interest in Russia had become
deeply centred in the plight of the latter
army. It was by this time fighting a
series of rearguard actions with its wary
and well-handled opponents. Although
the majority of well-informed military
critics assumed the ultimate destruction
of this army as a fighting force,
the extent of the assistance it might
receive from the German side could
not be gauged with accuracy. Thus
a special correspondent of the <cite>Daily
Telegraph</cite> wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span> from Petrograd on
September 11:</p>

<p>“The theory is put forward that at
any rate the greater part of the 300,000
men whom the Germans are known to
have withdrawn from their western
front, and who are supposed to have
been replaced by the Landwehr and
the Landsturm corps, have been directed
to the assistance of the Austrians, and
not to East Prussia. An army paper
issued officially at the front for the
information of the troops says that
on September 5 and 6 the battle continued
on the Austrian front. The
Russian troops operating between Lublin
and the Vistula had occupied the river
Chodel. They had to deal with a well-entrenched
enemy, and therefore the
attack developed rather slowly. Moving
from Krasnostaw, the Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
force attempted to reach the railway
line between Lublin and Cholm, to cut
the communications between those two
places; but the plan was frustrated by
the battle of September 2 and 3 at
Suchodol and other Russian counter-moves.
The position of the Russians
was, on September 6, much stronger,
and Krasnostaw was in their hands.
There were then also pretty plain signs
of a general Austrian retreat.”</p>

<p>These German reinforcements amounted,
at all events, to one or two army
corps, and with their co-operation hard
fighting took place on September 8-9
along the entire front. It is significant
that 10 per cent. of the prisoners taken
on those days are said to have been
Germans. The Austrian commander
appears to have strengthened his left
wing, now resting on the Vistula, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
expense of his right in order to attempt
to hold the relentless flanking movement
of General Russky. A large Austrian
force was thrown for this purpose along
a front running roughly from Lubisch to
Komarno, which had formed a rallying-point
for considerable numbers of the
army broken up near Lemberg. Along
this line they managed to entrench with
some skill and elaboration, and Russky
encountered a stubborn resistance in the
task of turning them out, though it has
been claimed on the Russian side that the
enemy as a rule has been generally loth
to wait for the bayonets to cross.</p>

<p>This Austrian conception of a counterstroke
of their heavily reinforced right
wing, with the intention of driving Russky
back upon Lemberg, was in the main a
good one. It commenced on September
9, when, according to one who was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
the firing-line, the Austrians essayed “repeated
and stubborn attacks with the
object of crushing the Russian left wing
and getting round their right. These
movements were met by vigorous counter-attacks,
and in order to ease the pressure
the army on the Vistula, and particularly
that portion to the south of Lublin, was
ordered to push forward and, if possible,
strike at the enemy’s rear. Accordingly
the Russian forces in South Poland
pressed on from the line Solez-Opole-Vichowe-Samostie-Komarow,
and, after
desperate fighting, drove the Austrians
from their entrenched positions. On
September 9 the enemy’s resistance was
overcome, and he retired all along the
line, with the Russians in pursuit. In
the battles of that and the preceding day
the Russians took 150 cannon, several
machine-guns, and 3,000 prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>“On the 10th, while the chase of the
retreating Austrians was proceeding in
this quarter, the Russians in the direction
of Lemberg were called upon to sustain
repeated assaults. These were, however,
all repulsed with heavy loss, eight
guns and more than four thousand
prisoners being captured. Apparently
the Austrians withdrawing from the
Lublin province fought a rearguard action
on the 12th, as mention is made of an
obstinate battle on that day which ended
with the rout of the enemy, who was
compelled to abandon his wounded.
Evidently in concert with this stand
the Austrians to the west of Lemberg
delivered three furious night attacks
between the 11th and 12th. From the
impetuosity with which the assaults were
pressed home it was evident that they
were a last despairing attempt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
sweep back the onflowing wave of Russians.”</p>

<p>In a word, this series of desperate
attacks and counter-attacks resulted in
the total failure of the Austrian army,
though stiffened by its German supports,
to “hold” their terrible opponents.
But it was no easy victory. Both sides
fought with devoted courage and stubborn
tenacity. Much of the ground was
cut up with marshy streams and belts
of treacherous swamp land, and one of
the harrowing features of this battle
was that numbers of dead lay unburied
among the morasses or half sunk in
the shallow streams and hundreds of
wounded wretches died among these
abandoned dead, undiscovered by the
peasants of the district until it was too
late.</p>

<p>In the close fighting the Russian losses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
were necessarily heavy, but the Petrograd
official estimates of the Austro-German
casualties from the capture of Lemberg
up to and including this hard-won
triumph on the Vistula simply stagger
the imagination, and suggest that the
computation was somewhat loosely made.
These were the figures:</p>

<p style="margin-left:1em">
Killed and wounded, 250,000 men.<br />
Prisoners, 100,000 men.<br />
Guns captured, 400.<br />
</p>

<p>The last of these figures is probably
nearest the truth. It would include the
numerous guns secured by the surrender
of Mikolaiev, as well as those taken on
the battle-field. In the great battle the
Russian artillery is said to have outnumbered
that of the enemy in the proportion
of two to one, and the Austrians
had to abandon many batteries among
the marshes when the retreat began.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Amongst these were some of their formidable
field-howitzers.</p>

<p>Amongst the Russian corps commanders
specially distinguished during
these days of battle, and decorated by the
Tsar with the Cross of St. George for his
part in the victory, was the Bilarian
Radko Dimitrieff. He has had a remarkable
career. Born in 1859, passed
out of the Military School of Sofia as a
lieutenant at the age of twenty, and
then studied for a while in the Staff
College at St. Petersburg. He had rejoined
the Bulgarian army as a captain
when there came the withdrawal of the
Russian officers who held the higher commands,
and the sudden attack by Servia.
Dimitrieff, though only a captain, acted
as a general at the victory of Slivnitza,
and there laid the foundation of his
career. The Bulgars called him “little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Napoleon,” partly on account of a
certain personal resemblance to the
“little Corporal,” partly as a tribute to
his genius for command. He served for
ten years in the Russian army, and on his
return to Bulgaria was appointed first
chief of the General Staff, and then to the
command of a district. In the war of
the Balkan League he commanded the
3rd Bulgarian Army, won the first victory
at Kirk-Kilisse and shared the after-triumphs
of the campaign in Thrace.
On the outbreak of the present war he
at once offered his services once more to
Russia.</p>

<p>In the official record of these operations
special mention is made of the uniformly
good work of the Cossack and other
cavalry, who appear to have established
as thorough a personal ascendancy over
the enemy’s mounted troops as did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
that of the Franco-British army in the
western theatre of war.</p>

<p>A similar remark may be applied to
the achievements of the Russian air-craft
in this region. The Grand-duke seeks out
for special commendation in this connection
the work of Air-Scout Tkarchoff.
While returning from a reconnaissance
his machine was shot at and a bullet
penetrated the oil-tank. With wonderful
nerve and resource, the brave Tkarchoff
managed to plug the bullet-hole
with his foot, in that way stopping the
flow of the oil and preventing a collapse.
At last he was able to descend, though
under heavy fire from the enemy, and
eventually he saved his aeroplane with
the help of two soldiers.</p>

<p>The Russian forward movement was
very naturally speeded up by the quickened
retirement of the foe. Having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
crossed the Lower San River without
encountering any resistance, Russky’s
army entered the town of Gorodek and
Mosciske, which brought them within
one day’s march of Jaroslav. When the
Austrian Government reorganised the
defences of Galicia more than twenty
years ago it was at first intended to make
Jaroslav instead of Przemysl the eastern
stronghold of the province. The fortifications
were begun and then left in an
unfinished state, but on the outbreak of
the war these incomplete works were
taken in hand and made the basis of a
strong system of entrenchments. It is
an important place, some twenty miles
north of Przemysl, and covering the
junction of the eastern railways of
Galicia with the main line to Cracow.
Strong redoubts, to the number of more
than twenty in all, had been erected on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
both banks of the San. The reduction
of the place would greatly minimise the
value of Przemysl to the Austrians and
enable two railways to be used both in
connection with the siege of that fortress
and the operations against Cracow. The
progress of the Russian advance had by
this time&mdash;the third week of September&mdash;given
them possession of other eastern
lines of railway with large quantities of
rolling-stock, tanks of naphtha, benzine,
and large stores of wood and other
material. On every side, as the advance
converged upon Jaroslav, were seen
evidences of the disorder of the recent
Austrian retreat in the amount of arms
and material of war abandoned in the
swamps or by the roadside.</p>

<p>Anything like full details of the garrison
of Jaroslav and its actual preparedness
at the time of the onslaught are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
available. This is partly owing to the
Russian habit of lumping together the
numbers of prisoners and guns captured
at various points, and partly because
a portion of the garrison succeeded in
escaping. But it seems clear that a
vigorous night-attack took two of the
most important works, and that this
rendered inevitable the early fall of the
place.</p>

<p>In point of fact, the actual investment
lasted only three days. Its reduction
was semi-officially described as “a
pleasant surprise,” for it left open the
Cracow road, while the undoubted
strength and importance of a town of
20,000 inhabitants and protected by a
score of well-equipped forts, could not
be over-estimated. Moreover, the only
railway to Przemysl now left open to the
enemy was a small single line. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
officers deemed to have been most distinguished
in the success of the operation
were Generals Ivanoff, Alexieff, and
Dragomiroff, who were all decorated.
Between September 11-14 the vast captures
included a general, 535 officers,
83,531 men, 637 guns (38 German), 44
machine-guns, seven flags, and 823 ammunition-wagons.</p>

<p>With Jaroslav in its hands, the Tsar’s
army could now close up the ring of steel
with which the greater prize of Przemysl
was being encircled. In summing up
the satisfactory results so far achieved,
an eminent Russian critic, Colonel Shumsky,
pointed out how utterly the enemy’s
plans had come to grief. “It was supposed,”
he said, “that the Austrian
army approaching Ivangorod would have
joined up with the Germans advancing
from Posen and Thorn. By this means<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Western Poland would have been cut off,
and there would have been a final development
of the Austro-German forces on the
line from Ivangorod and East Prussia to
the sea, which is nearly a straight line.
By moving out from the meridian of the
East Prussian line, the enemy would have
had the advantage of shortening the
road of attack. This was very important
for reasons of time. As the Austrian
troops were completely beaten, that plan
has broken down. The Austrians are
retreating most probably to Cracow, and
are attempting to arrange a new strategic
front with the Germans for an attack in
three echelons&mdash;the first from Eastern
Prussia, the second from the line Tschensto-chau-Wjelun-Slessin,
and the third
from the district of Cracow.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br /><span class="mediumfont">RUSSIA’S SUCCESS AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE</span></h2>


<p>The armies of the Tsar had by the middle
of September established so firm a foothold
upon Austrian territory, and so
remote were the chances of their being
dislodged from it, that little surprise was
felt at the issue of a manifesto addressed
by the Grand-duke Nicholas to the inhabitants
of the invaded country. It
was circulated in all the nine languages
of that wonderfully polyglot population,
and the text of it was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Peoples of Austria-Hungary</span>,&mdash;The
Government of Vienna declared war
on Russia because the great Empire,
faithful to its historic traditions, could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
not abandon inoffensive Servia or permit
her enslavement.</p>

<p>“Peoples of Austria-Hungary,&mdash;In
making my entry into the territory of
Austria-Hungary I declare to you, in the
name of the great Tsar, that Russia, who
has often shed her blood for the emancipation
of nations from a foreign yoke,
seeks only the restoration of right and
justice. To you peoples of Austria-Hungary
Russia also brings liberty and
the realisation of your national hopes.</p>

<p>“During long centuries the Austro-Hungarian
Government sowed among
you discord and hostility, for she knew
that your quarrels were the basis of her
empire over you. Russia, on the other
hand, only aims at enabling each of you
to develop and prosper, while preserving
the precious heritage of your fathers,
your language, and your faith, and allowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
each of you, united to his brethren, to
live in peace and harmony with his neighbours,
respecting their national rights.</p>

<p>“Being sure that you will all lend your
strength to the realisation of this end, I
appeal to you to welcome the Russian
troops as faithful friends who are fighting
for your best dreams.</p>

<p class="marginright">(Signed) “<span class="smcap">Nicholas</span>, Commander-in-Chief
and Aide-de-Camp General.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The present may be a convenient
opportunity for pausing to consider
briefly a few of the more picturesque
“sidelights” of the war, while vast
armies are mustering to the onslaught in
Poland, in East Prussia, and in Austro-Hungary.
A good impression was created
throughout the world, as showing the
spirit animating the Russian people and
government in the prosecution of the
struggle, by the prohibition of the sale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
vodka “for ever” in the Tsar’s dominions.
Russia would henceforth be a sober
country, and in the spirit of clear-minded
cheerfulness and serenity would see this
world-contest through to the bitter end.
About the same time another Imperial
edict seemed to imply that the Tsar was
so well satisfied with the numbers of
troops already mobilised, and with the
steady progress being effected by the
field-armies, that Russia’s last line of
men was not to be called to the colours.</p>

<p>Yet the masses of troops still available
by the half-beaten Austrians were remarkable
in the extreme. The calling up
of their Landsturm gave them a million
of fresh men with which to recoup the
enormous wastage of the earlier battles.
To this new million, an estimate of the
astute Colonel Shumsky adds the further
resources of the German allies. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
reminds us that “On the list of the
German Minister of War there are
4,300,000 trained men. Supposing that
the Germans have lost 800,000 in the
fields of Belgium, France, Eastern Prussia,
and Galicia, then they must have
3,500,000 trained men, of whom 1,000,000
are in France. The remaining 2,500,000
are not occupied with France, and consequently
can operate on the east front.
But it must be remembered that if Austria
and Germany have a population of
110,000,000 from which to derive their
troops, their antagonists have not less
than 220,000,000. In the battles of the
present war strategy and tactics are
playing a secondary part. All that
counts is the numbers and the spirit of
the soldier.”</p>

<p>An Italian estimate of about the same
date stated that by the month of October<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Russia would have fully three millions
of men actively engaged in this complicated
theatre of operations&mdash;an overwhelming
avalanche of troops, flushed
with victory and confident of the ultimate
result. The general reader derived
some idea of what the preparation for
fight of the units of such an embattled
host really means from a vivid account
in the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> by Mr. Alan Lethbridge,
who had been deputed by that
journal to attend the headquarters of the
world’s most gigantic mobilisation. Mr.
Lethbridge records, with many human
touches, the gathering together of 30,000
Cossacks within four days after the outbreak
of hostilities. He makes one
realise the significance, to the mind of the
local Muscovite peasant, of what is to him
very essentially a holy war, because his
“Little Father” the Tsar orders it. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
tells, with rare lucidity and wealth of
detail, how he saw the green-and-gold
vested priests, with their ikons and huge
crosses borne before them, blessing the
great masses of men amid the prayers and
tears of their womenkind, and solemnly
impressing upon their auditors that this
was no war of aggression into which their
Tsar had felt himself forced to enter.
He describes how one Siberian township
alone (Omsk) contributed its quota of
75,000 conscripts, and how in a single
day he saw at least a hundred thousand
more being transported over one small
section of the Siberian railway. He emphasises
the extreme “teetotal” aspect
of all that he saw and heard, remarking
that perhaps nothing brought home to
one as much as this the realities and
possibilities of the true awakening of
Russia. Incidentally, he gossips amusingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
as to a rumour of Japanese
troops passing through Russian townships
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for “the front”&mdash;first
cousin, this, to the equally fantastic story
of Cossack soldiers having passed through
England. The following brief extract
from this correspondent’s account may
serve to illustrate the quiet, business-like
aspect of the mobilisation:</p>

<p>“A galloping Cossack with a red
pennon fluttering from his lance was our
first intimation that Russia was at war.
From the bridge of a steamer on the
river Irtish we could watch him. His
stout little pony easily kept abreast of
our boat, and his method of operating
was clearly visible. He would accost a
group of his brethren garnering their
harvest&mdash;for this is Cossack territory&mdash;there
would be some gesticulation, horses
would be seized and mounted, and within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
five minutes the harvest-fields of the
great Siberian steppe would be denuded
of their manhood. Such action was
repeated with almost monotonous precision
during that long summer day,
and it was thanks to this organisation
that on our arrival at Semipalatinsk, a
steppe town some 600 miles from railhead,
we found no less than 30,000 fully armed
and equipped Cossacks. This within
four days of the outbreak of hostilities.”</p>

<p>Side by side with this may be read
the testimony of Professor Pares of the
Liverpool University, whose intimate
knowledge of the country and its language
admirably qualified him for the
work of a correspondent with the Tsar’s
headquarters. Dr. Pares is just as emphatic
as the correspondent just quoted
on the subject of the enthusiasm and
unanimity pervading all classes of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
community with whom he came in contact.
He pays a passing tribute to
the high efficiency of Russia’s hospital
arrangements, to the fine and self-sacrificing
labours of all from the highest
to the lowest, and to the serenity and
confidence manifested on every side. He
saw the Grand-duchess Olga, sister of
the Emperor, working as a Sister of
Mercy, “under all the ordinary discipline
and conditions,” and heard how hard she
had had to labour after the early battles
of the campaign, when hospitals designed
for the accommodation of 200 patients
were compelled to accommodate at least
300 each. “One feels it is a great wave
rolling forward with one spirit driving it.”</p>

<p>Dr. Pares was present when the Tsar
in person visited Vilna, riding through
the streets quite unguarded. Vilna has
for the most part a Polish population,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
and from all sides the Tsar was greeted
with an enthusiasm that must have
deeply touched and moved him. In the
hospitals the Professor conversed with
many of the wounded belonging to both
sides. On the part of most of the
Austrians, he says, he found a general
disposition to believe that they had been
thoroughly overmatched on the battle-field.
A Russian lad of nineteen or
twenty, who had been sent back home,
not on account of wounds but because
of physical overstrain, remarked almost
with tears, “They are firing on my
brother and not on me. That is not
right&mdash;I ought to be where they all
are.”</p>

<p>A story worth interpolating here on
account of its military significance has
reference to a rumour that the German
Emperor had addressed a letter to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Dowager-Empress of Russia, calling her
“cousin,” in an attempt to induce her to
use her good offices with the Tsar in
order to bring about peace. This missive
eventually reached the headquarters of
the Grand-duke Nicholas, who is said to
have returned it to the Tsar with the
laconic comment: “If you do, our
armies will mutiny, and there will be a
revolution in all the Russias.” It is only
a soldier’s story, but it explains, especially
in the final sentence, why Russia has
beaten the Austrian, German, and Austro-German
armies successively.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more noteworthy as
emphasising the Russian record of initial
difficulties triumphed over than the
preponderance of Austro-German railway
power in the vast war-area. General
Kuropatkin, the Tsar’s Commander-in-Chief
in the war with Japan, had as far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
back as 1900 called attention to this
marked superiority in the Central Powers’
means of transport. Doubtless upon his
initiative, the Russian railway lines along
the Polish frontier were improved to a
certain extent. But, as Austria and Germany
were correspondingly busy, doubtless
much of what Kuropatkin had written
more than a dozen years before remained
true in 1914&mdash;indeed, the celerity with
which the enemy were enabled to rush
masses of troops to all their frontiers
must have been one of the earliest things
to impress any student of the struggle.
This is how Kuropatkin phrased his plea
for a good deal more energy in the
matters of railway development:</p>

<p>“By the expenditure of vast sums of
money, Germany has made ready in
the most comprehensive sense to march
rapidly across our borders with an army<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
of one million men. She has seventeen
lines of railway (twenty-three tracks)
leading to our frontiers, which would
enable her to send to the front more than
five hundred troop-trains daily. She can
concentrate the greater part of her armed
forces on our frontier within a few days
of the declaration of war; while, apart
from this question of speedy mobilisation,
she has at her command far greater
technical resources, such as light railways,
artillery, ordnance, and engineering
stores, particularly for telegraphs, mobile
siege parks, etc., than we have. She
has also made most careful preparation
for a determined defence of her own
border provinces, especially those of
Eastern Prussia.</p>

<p>“The first-class fortresses of Thorn,
Königsberg, and Posen are improved
yearly, entrenched camps are built at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the most important junctions, and material
lies ready stacked for the rapid
semi-permanent fortification of field positions.
The crossing-places on the Vistula
have been rapidly placed in a state of
defence, as have also the various towns
and large villages. The whole population,
indeed, is making ready for a
national struggle.</p>

<p>“In the matter of railway development
the Austrians have also left us far
behind. While they, by means of eight
lines of rail (ten tracks), can run two
hundred and sixty trains up to the frontier
every twenty-four hours, we can only
convey troops up to the same point on
four lines. As any of their troops on the
frontier would be in advance of the Carpathians,
this range was formerly looked
upon as an obstacle to retirement, and to
communication between Galicia and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
rest of Austria. But in the last ten years
it has been pierced by five lines of railway,
and preparations have been made to lay
three more.”</p>

<p>It will be perceived that General
Kuropatkin cherished no optimistic illusions
as to the ultimate aims and aspirations
of Germany, neither did he believe
that the shock could be much longer
delayed, having regard to the immense
burden of armaments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class="mediumfont">EBB AND FLOW IN EAST PRUSSIA</span></h2>


<p>General Rennenkampf’s brilliant raid
into East Prussia&mdash;which admirably
served its immediate purpose of causing
the Germans to transfer great masses of
men from the west to the east, thereby
relieving the pressure upon the Franco-British
allies in Northern France&mdash;had
closed with the brave Rennenkampf’s
heavy defeat of Osterode, or Tannenberg,
on the last day of August. Two days
later had happened, as a counterstroke,
General Russky’s capture of the capital
of Galicia with its thousands of prisoners
and hundreds of guns, so that, in familiar
language, “honours were easy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>In point of fact, Rennenkampf, approved
soldier in Europe as in Manchuria,
recovered with astonishing rapidity from
the severe set-back suffered by his army
in the swamps of Osterode on August 31.
While, as we have seen, that victory was
causing General von Hindenburg to be
acclaimed as the popular hero of the hour
in Germany, Rennenkampf had the satisfaction
of knowing that his defeat had not
appreciably relieved the pressure upon
the Austrian armies in the south.</p>

<p>On September 9 the army victorious
at Osterode ten days before (and believed
to consist of eleven corps) commenced a
general advance along the East Prussian
front into Russian Poland. For several
days subsequent to his retreat, Rennenkampf
had remained stationary along
a line traversing the railway at right angles
between Königsberg and Insterburg.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
This position he clung to tenaciously
until noon of September 10, when the
long-ranging shell-fire of the German
fortress guns which were being used for
the purpose, together with a powerful
turning movement around their left
flank, obliged the Russians to continue
their retreat. They fell back on the
11th-12th in a northerly direction slightly
east of Wirballen, where a fresh stand
was made. Although the scene of action
had now been transferred from German
to Russian territory, the advantage was
by no means wholly with the Teutons.
They found themselves operating in a
strange and unfriendly region, and one in
which the railway system could not be of
much use to them for the rapid transit
of men and material, seeing that the
German and Russian lines have different
gauges. Moreover, Austria’s military<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
misfortunes might now be deemed to
have eliminated that Power from the
problem. And Rennenkampf was resolved
not to fight another pitched battle
until he could do so under favourable
auspices.</p>

<p>Local incidents along this Russian-Polish
frontier included the dropping of
German bombs and proclamations into
the town of Suwalki. By these bombs
the railway-station and schoolhouse were
damaged and one child was killed. The
frontier town of Filipovo also suffered a
partial bombardment. While Rennenkampf’s
headquarters were at Insterburg,
certain of the inhabitants of that
place were caught red-handed in the act
of signalling movements of troops to
their “friend the enemy,” while in a few
cases Russian troops were fired on from
houses of the townspeople. Several of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
these irregular belligerents were put to
death by sentence of a court-martial.
Next morning a German aeroplane
dropped in the Russian lines this audacious
message addressed to Rennenkampf:
“Your troops are shooting
peaceful citizens. If this is done without
your knowledge, stop it at once! If
the troops are carrying out your orders,
then know, General, that the blood of
these innocent people falls on your head,
and on yours alone.”</p>

<p>It was not until September 17 that the
Russian general’s clever manœuvring was
rewarded by his being able to resume
the offensive after the enemy had not
penetrated more than twenty-five miles
into Russian Poland. On the evening
of that day the Germans realised that
their attempted outflanking of Rennenkampf’s
right was being checkmated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
by a vigorous counter-offensive. Very
severe fighting took place at or near the
junction of the railways between Kovno
and Vilna, and at Stednicki, where the
Niemen is joined by the Dubissa. The
Russians held the banks of the latter
tributary in force. By the 18th the
enemy were falling back from Suwalki
and four other townships which appear
to have been the high-water mark of
their advance. They lost four guns and
many prisoners.</p>

<p>Having regard to the fact that a large
proportion of the men of the German
army corps employed here were troops
that had been withdrawn from the western
theatre of war, it is interesting to
note that they are accused of having
behaved with much lack of discipline
along the line of route. Such accusations
are common enough to all warfare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and the only point of interest here is
that they certainly were for the most
part troops drawn from the area of operations
where so many allegations of
“atrocities” have been preferred against
them.</p>

<p>Roughly speaking, one continuous
battle raged along the East Prussian
borderland from September 25 to October
3. This has been styled the “Battle
of Augustoff,” otherwise Suwalki, from
the name of the province or “government”
covering the battle-ground. The
battle began in the vast forest that
covers miles of country on the Russian
side of the frontier. Through these
woodlands Rennenkampf retired, fighting
a series of rearguard actions on a broad
front. An episode of the battle was
the attack of the German right on the
fortress of Ossovetz, a place of some importance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
as it guards a crossing of the
river Bobr in the midst of a region of
marshy forest.</p>

<p>The garrison met the attack by a night
sortie against the German advance,
which had got into difficult ground among
the swamps and woods. A correspondent
who was with the Russian force
gives this account of the fighting:</p>

<p>“The Germans had not proceeded
more than nine miles when they found
that they could not move their guns a
yard farther owing to the marshy nature
of the ground. In this predicament they
opened fire with their artillery, and then
sent forward their infantry with numerous
machine-guns. The latter got within
four miles of the fortress, but they made
no further progress.</p>

<p>“During the night the Russians made
a sortie, and, marching by roads and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
paths of which the enemy were completely
ignorant, they completely enveloped
both the German wings. Imagining that
they held all the practicable roads, the
Germans had concentrated their attention
on the fortress and neglected their
flanks. When the enveloping movement
became apparent, a fierce engagement
ensued, the enemy being completely at a
disadvantage. The fortress guns mowed
them down on the open road, while the
Russian infantry poured a devastating
fire into their wings. The battle lasted
thirty-six hours, and ended in the complete
rout of the Germans, who fled in
disorder along the Graevo road. All the
German guns which had stuck in the
marshy ground were captured.”</p>

<p>Retiring through the frontier woods
Rennenkampf fell back upon and recrossed
the Niemen. It would have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
well for Von Hindenburg if he had contented
himself with having driven the
invaders out of East Prussia. But,
flushed with victory, and underrating
the fighting power of his opponent, he
endeavoured to force a way across the
Niemen. By this time, however, the
Russian mobilisation had long been completed,
and Rennenkampf was reinforced
by several army corps when he reached
the right bank of the river. The German
attempt to cross it in the face of superior
numbers ended in a disaster. The
attack was pushed with reckless daring,
and simultaneously at many points
attempts were made to construct pontoon
bridges under the fire of the Russian
artillery. Every attempt ended in failure.
Hundreds of dead bodies floated
down the stream, and the efforts of
the German gunners to crush out the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
fire of the enemy’s batteries were unavailing.
At last, after incurring much
useless loss, Von Hindenburg abandoned
the attempt under the pressure of a
Russian attack on his flank from the
southward.</p>

<p>Once more there was fighting day after
day in the forests of Augustovo, as Von
Hindenburg’s army fell back through the
woods towards the borders of East
Prussia, pursued by the victorious Russians.</p>

<p>Rennenkampf claimed that during
these operations the losses of the Germans
amounted to 60,000 men in killed,
wounded, and prisoners. The scenes of
desolation around Suwalki and Augustoff
after this sanguinary fighting were pitiful
in the extreme. Practically everything
had been destroyed, so that they resembled
towns of the dead. All bridges<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
had been blown up, and but for embankments
and broken telegraph-wires it was
hardly recognisable that there had been a
railway at all. Wrote a <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>
war correspondent of the unholy scene:</p>

<p>“On the fields one sees the ravages of
artillery projectiles&mdash;deep, conical holes
five or six feet in diameter. Here, too,
one finds shrapnel cases, splinters of
shells, skeletons of horses, fragments of
blood-stained clothing, cartridge-pouches,
blue-grey coats of German soldiers,
empty schnapps and beer-bottles. In one
trench there was a particularly large
number of empty bottles. It is evident
that the German soldiers invigorate
themselves with alcohol before battle.
Near one of these batteries of bottles was
a soldiers’ common grave. Along the
road are many burnt houses and plundered
farms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of entire villages, in some cases
only blackened ruins remain. Inside the
houses that have not suffered in this way
nothing remains whole. Pillows and
quilts have been ripped open and the
down scattered about. Samovars, dented
by heels of heavy boots, are lying about
on the floor. Cupboards and drawers
have been rummaged with bayonets.</p>

<p>“What the Prussians could not carry
away they have spoilt. Whole forests
have been hewed down or burnt. Wide
areas have been cleared for fields of fire.
Peasants’ gardens have been stripped of
their produce. Potatoes, carrots, and
other vegetables have been dug up wholesale
and carried off. Local inhabitants,
mostly Lithuanians and White Russians,
have been so terrified by the Germans
that they hardly realise what has happened
to them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>The enemy next endeavoured to entrench
and maintain himself upon a line
running from Wirballen to Lyck; but on
October 8 his flanks were enveloped after
a fierce struggle, and the Russians
marched into Lyck. They were now
for the second time establishing themselves
upon the soil of East Prussia&mdash;and
this time with little likelihood of a somewhat
demoralised foe being able to expel
them in a hurry. For the German offensive
along the Niemen had utterly failed.</p>

<p>At the time (October 8) when Rennenkampf
followed up this triumph by
driving the enemy out of Lyck, his
troops had already been fighting for
seven days and nights without a rest.
But they were flushed with victory.
This engagement of the 8th is likely to
be known as the battle of Ratchka, from
the name of the village on which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
German right rested. It was ascertained
that they had been reinforced with men
and guns (several batteries being captured)
from Königsberg. The rapidity
of the advance seems to have had a
staggering effect, and the enemy lost
hundreds of his horses in the marshy
boglands of the Suwalki province, leaving
his heavy artillery, or much of it, to
its fate.</p>

<p>A wounded Russian officer, in a description
of the battle of Augustoff contributed
to a Petrograd journal, pays a
deserved tribute to the coolness, intelligence,
and enthusiasm of the Slav soldier
under fire. The troops, he says, were
simply “chuckling with delight” on
receiving an order to turn the enemy out
of a position which could only be carried
by great expenditure of life. With the
utmost <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang-froid</i> they put the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to rout, then leaving them to the tender
mercies of a particularly vigorous and
merciless pursuit by the Cossack cavalry.
Fresh enthusiasm was aroused by the
appearance of General Rennenkampf,
who rode on to the position to thank his
gallant soldiers for the extraordinary
exertions that had given them the well-worn
field. The music of several bands
then joined in the celebration, playing the
beautiful Russian National Hymn to a
perfect tornado of cheers from the weary
but satisfied troops.</p>

<p>What a change had come over the scene
within one month! A proud and unbroken
enemy no longer retained a foothold
upon Russian territory. Whether
regarded as a serious invasion, or as a
movement of co-ordination with the
vaster invasion of Russian Poland now
about to be described, the attempt had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
been signally beaten back in blood.
“Whether,” wrote an English critic of
the situation, “the Russians intend to aim
at Berlin or Vienna, is of minor consequence.
The great point is that they
seem able to do what they like and to
choose their particular objective as they
please. Nothing has been more exhilarating
than the brilliant strategy of Petrograd.
The Russian soldiers have proved
not only their steady persistence&mdash;a
quality which we always knew to be one
of their principal assets&mdash;but also a
rapidity of movement and a dashing
spirit of attack with which the world was
hardly prepared to credit them.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br /><span class="mediumfont">THE DEFENCE OF THE VISTULA</span></h2>


<p>General Rennenkampf received from
the Tsar telegrams congratulating him
upon his well-ordered retreat and his
victorious counter-attack and resumed
invasion of East Prussia. In this message
the Tsar noted that, during the
retreat, the Russian General had not left
a single pound’s weight of supplies to the
enemy.</p>

<p>Before passing on to the story of the
larger conflict in Central Poland, we may
note some interesting incidents which
occurred during this ebb and flow of the
war on the East Prussian borders. One
of these incidents shows that, with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
their elaborate war training, the Germans
were liable, from lack of ordinary precautions,
to fall very easily into a dangerous
trap. It occurred during the
fighting around Wirballen, the little
frontier town well known to all travellers
from Western Europe to Russia as the
point at which the railway from Ostend
by Berlin crosses the frontier. The place
was held at the time by the Russians, and
was attacked by a German column.</p>

<p>After about an hour and a half’s brisk
fusillade, which was but weakly replied
to, the Germans advanced, fearlessly and
without further precautions, under the
impression that their enemy had withdrawn.
But on crossing the frontier-line
into Russian territory, their feelings
became too much for them, and, preluded
by loud shouts of “Hoch!” they sang
with fervour their familiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span> <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Wacht am
Rhein</i>. At that moment the Russians,
who had remained carefully sheltered by
their trenches all the time, poured in a
deadly rifle-fire, backed by the immediate
charge of a sotnia of Cossacks. Taken
at a disadvantage and utterly surprised,
it was said that not a man of the German
force survived to recross the border.</p>

<p>The German Emperor’s beautiful hunting-box
at Rominten near Insterburg,
where he had been wont to sojourn every
autumn for the shooting of elk and other
big game, fell into Russian hands. The
following humorous extract is from a
letter written home by one of the officers
who had the good fortune to be temporarily
quartered amid such luxurious
surroundings:</p>

<p>“After a series of terrible battles, we
are reposing on William’s magnificent
estate. Undreamt-of beauty is all round<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
us. The place is splendidly equipped, so
that we have at our disposal everything
we could wish for, and we are riding
his celebrated horses, and enjoying
delicious dinners prepared by his man
cook. Especially beautiful is the park,
with its glorious shady avenues. It
swarms with rare animals, and birds are
flying free everywhere. By the way, our
soldiers have caught a William parrot
in the park. It speaks excellent German,
but our men are teaching it their own
language, and it is learning to address its
Imperial master with compliments I
should blush to repeat in company.”</p>

<p>Another isolated but interesting incident
of this Prusso-Polish frontier fighting
was the destruction near Mlawa, on
September 5, of the Zeppelin airship Z 5,&mdash;the
second Zeppelin known to have
been brought down in this region since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
the commencement of hostilities. The
Z 5 had been cruising in the neighbourhood
for several days, and it was not
until the date mentioned that her movements
were observed to be growing very
irregular and uncertain. She tried hard
to shape a course for her own frontier, but
finally collapsed in some fields. It was
then found that her envelope had been
literally riddled by Russian bullets. Her
crew managed, however, to blow up
the airship, whose commander, severely
wounded, requested to be placed out of
sight behind a haystack, so that he
“might not witness the end of his dear
Zeppelin.”</p>

<p>A possible explanation of Von Hindenburg’s
advance to the Niemen was that
the German General Staff hoped by a
serious threat in this direction to lead the
Russians to diminish the pressure upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Galicia in order to reinforce their right.
At the time of the operations Colonel
Shumsky, perhaps the best-known military
writer in Russia, pointed this out,
and at the same time suggested that the
menace from East Prussia could have no
serious result. “Will the Germans,” he
asked, “compel us to abandon the operations
in the Carpathians and throw our
forces across to the Niemen, or shall we
compel the Germans to restrict their
activity on the Niemen, and fling themselves
into Cracow and Galicia to save
Austro-Hungary? The advance of the
Germans from East Prussia cannot have
any decisive object. A lightning-like
stroke could only be delivered if the Germans
were finished with France and could
move all their forces against us.”</p>

<p>It appears that something was done to
draw reinforcements from the western<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
theatre of war for the German armies on
the Polish frontier. Reserve and Landwehr
troops organised since the declaration
of war were moved in the same
direction, and, according to Russian estimates
of a subsequent date, by the end of
September the Germans had concentrated
twelve army corps of about 400,000 men
on the frontier in the centre about Thorn
and Posen. It appears, however, that
at the time the Russian Staff did not
realise that this formidable concentration
was in progress, and thought that their
opponents were putting forth their chief
efforts on the two flanks of the long curved
line northwards&mdash;for the struggle in East
Prussia, and southwards for the defensive
campaign in Galicia.</p>

<p>The Germans, however, were preparing
for a serious stroke in the centre of the
Polish theatre of war, and, despite his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
failure on the Niemen, the chief command
of this great effort was entrusted to
General Hindenburg. The fame he had acquired
by his expulsion of the enemy from
East Prussia had only been slightly overclouded
by the defeat on the Niemen, and
it was thought that the German generals
in East Prussia could be safely left to
defend against Rennenkampf’s farther
advance <a id="Ref_80"></a>through the wilderness of forest, marsh,
and lake which forms the natural barrier
along the frontier of the province.</p>

<p>The German plan was to abandon the
mere passive defence of their frontiers,
assume the offensive, and strike a blow
directly against Warsaw and the group
of fortresses beyond the Vistula that
form the citadel of the Russian power
in Poland. The German armies were to
advance from the borders of the provinces
of Posen and Silesia in a converging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
march upon Warsaw. The left
column from Thorn was to advance along
the south bank of the great bend of the
Vistula which runs north-westward from
Novo Gorgievsk by Plock. The central
column from the Posen frontier was to
march on Lowicz and the great factory
town of Lodz&mdash;after Warsaw the largest
place in Poland&mdash;the third column, which
had already occupied Czenstochowa,
just inside the Russian frontier towards
Silesia, was to protect the flank of the
advance and march on the Vistula in
the direction of Ivangorod. A fourth
column was to march on Kielce, forming
the link with an Austrian advance
through Northern Galicia towards the
river San, which was intended to reoccupy
Jaroslav and raise the siege of
Przemysl.</p>

<p>The country through which the line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
advance lay was the undulating Polish
plain, a district with many clumps and
belts of forest, and almost destitute of
good roads. Once the weather broke, at
the end of autumn, much of the ground
would be reduced to a marshy condition
that would make it impassable until the
first frost of winter hardened it again.
The German Staff hoped to carry through
the campaign while the region was
everywhere practicable, and, even if
Warsaw were not captured, to make the
Vistula their line of defence, where, having
secured the railways behind them, they
might hope to hold their own on a front
shorter by many hundred miles than the
long curving frontier of their own territory.</p>

<p>It was expected that the first movement
into the Polish plain would have
the result of forcing the enemy not only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to abandon the advance already begun
towards Cracow, but to evacuate a considerable
part of the ground they had
overrun in Galicia, and at the same time
to withdraw some of their forces from the
East Prussian border. German reports
went to show that the enemy had no
large forces in the country between the
middle Vistula and the Posen-Thorn
frontier. The first stage of the German
advance would, therefore, not be likely
to meet with any very serious opposition.</p>

<p>Why, it may be asked, had not the
Russian military authorities taken fuller
precautions, in the earlier days of the
war, for safeguarding the Polish territory
from invasion and spoliation? Why had
not the immensely long and valuable
line of the river Vistula in particular
been occupied in heavy force at the time
of the mobilisation in August? A semi-official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
statement of mid-October replied
definitely to these criticisms. It was
pointed out that the consideration was
a purely military one. It was a fundamental
rule of warfare to sacrifice everything
of lesser importance to the main
issue. Thus, the first “impudent invasion”
from the German side had demanded
a large transfer of troops. Next
the Austrian concentration in Galicia,
and their attack in the Lublin district,
had needed a big force in that quarter.
Thirdly, the invasion by way of Eastern
Prussia had required substantial means
to deal with and crush it. “This temporary
victimisation of the Vistula district
is the outcome of a praiseworthy
decision of our strategy. Now the situation
is different, and strategic and other
aims coincide upon the Vistula until the
enemy has been finally beaten.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Intense enthusiasm was aroused
throughout Russia by the announcement
that the Tsar would proceed in person
to the fighting area. In front of the
Winter Palace at Petrograd, thousands of
students and others paraded and demonstrated
in honour of their “Little
Father,” as well as to celebrate news of
the victories in Galicia and East Prussia.</p>

<p>The German columns met with little
resistance in their advance across the
Polish plain. Lodz was occupied, and
the two northern columns gained touch
east of the town and advanced on a
wide front between the northern bend
of the Vistula and its tributary, the
Pilitza, their objective being Warsaw.
The right moved forward through Kielce
and Radom against Ivangorod. According
to German accounts, the advancing
armies were joined by large numbers of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the peasants, who welcomed them as
deliverers; but the Russian story is
that the people fled in terror before the
invaders.</p>

<p>We have to depend during the war for
our news of what is happening in Poland
almost entirely upon Russian accounts
official and non-official. The German
wireless reports give only the briefest
outline of the official view of the situation
taken at Berlin, and these reports are
often cut down by our own censorship.
The few reports from Berlin that were
allowed to be published in England contained,
it is true, some references to a
victorious advance of the Austro-German
armies into Poland in the first days of
October. But, at the time, these were
treated as fictitious claims of success, for
it seemed strange that, in the numerous
telegrams that came from Russian sources,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
there was not a word of any important
events in the central theatre of war.
Official news told of fighting on the East
Prussian border and in Galicia, and non-official
reports were full of detailed statements
as to the complete collapse of
the Austrians, an invasion of Hungary
through the Carpathians, attacks upon
Przemysl that had reduced the fortress
to desperate straits, and steady progress
in the direction of Cracow.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a surprise to every
one when, towards the end of the second
week in October the official bulletin from
St. Petersburg admitted that Von Hindenburg
had forced his way up to the left
bank of the middle Vistula and overrun
all Western Poland&mdash;this, too, at a time
when all the rest of Europe believed that
the Germans were still on the frontiers
of Poland and Galicia, and busy preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the fortresses of Thorn and Posen for a
siege. It was afterwards explained that
the Russian retirement to the Vistula
was a deliberate “strategic” movement
intended to lure the Germans to destruction.
But it is fairly certain that the
Russians had sent such large masses of
men northwards and southwards for the
operations in East Prussia and Galicia,
besides providing for an army they were
concentrating on the Black Sea coast
and the Caucasus, that their forces
in Central Poland had been considerably
reduced. During Von Hindenburg’s
advance they were busily engaged in
reinforcing the army on the middle
Vistula and in the Polish triangle of fortresses,
and for this purpose they drew
in several army corps from their left.</p>

<p>Weakened by this withdrawal, the
Russian army in Galicia gave way before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
the advance of the Austrian armies on
the German right. Jaroslav was abandoned,
the siege of Przemysl was temporarily
raised, and General Brussiloff
concentrated his forces to protect Lemberg
from recapture.</p>

<p>The right column of the German
advance, pushing forward through Radom,
reached the river Vistula near Ivangorod,
tried to force a passage over it below the
fortress, and attacked the outlying defences
of the place. The columns of the
left and centre, under Von Hindenburg’s
personal command, penetrated to within
a few miles of Warsaw, where at last
they met with serious opposition. The
Grand-duke Nicholas began to push a
considerable force westward from the
city to protect it from even a temporary
occupation, while his main line of defence
lay along the right bank of the Vistula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
above and below the city. It was early
on the morning of October 11 that the
thunder of the guns told the inhabitants
of Warsaw that a great battle had begun
at the very gates of their city.</p>

<p>During the preceding days there had
been rumours not only that the Germans
were approaching in great force, but that
the Grand-duke was about to evacuate
the city.</p>

<p>The wealthier classes of Warsaw are
largely made up of those who hold
government positions, or whose interests
are, in one way or another, closely connected
with the existing Russian regime,
and there was something like a panic as
the rumour spread that the place might
soon be in the hands of an invader.
The alarm was increased by the sight of
German aeroplanes circling high over the
houses and dropping bombs into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
streets. One of these aeroplanes had an
accident to its engine and fell on the
estate of Count Briansky in the suburbs
of Warsaw. The aviators were murdered
by a mob of peasants before they could
be taken prisoners by the troops.</p>

<p>For three days Warsaw could hear the
cannon thunder close at hand. Indeed,
at first, it seemed to be coming nearer
and nearer on the south side of the city.
The arrival of long trains of wounded men
hour after hour told that the fight was
a costly one, and this fighting close to
Warsaw was only part of an engagement
stretching out upon an enormous front
along the Vistula. The Grand-duke was,
however, holding his own and using the
central position in front of Warsaw as a
starting-point from which to drive a way
into the German line, while along the
river the enemy were wasting their forces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
in desperate attempts to effect the crossing.</p>

<p>The Siberian Army Corps, now in
action for the first time in Europe, proved
themselves fighting men. Their attack
turned the scale in the centre. The great
wedge pushed forward from Moscow
began to tell upon the German resistance,
and as it gained more and more
ground new masses of troops were brought
across the river to extend the region of
the close fighting. The weather had
broken, and the battle was fought out
under cloudy skies and amid driving
showers of sleety rain.</p>

<p>On October 14 Warsaw heard the
cannon thunder less loudly. The enemy’s
centre was being driven steadily back
with the loss of thousands of prisoners
and many guns. Higher up the Vistula
towards Ivangorod the German attempts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to gain a footing on the east bank had
also failed.</p>

<p>According to the <cite>Utro Rossii</cite>, elaborate
attempts to cross the Vistula on rafts
(after aeroplane reconnaissance) took
place at two points, between Ivangorod
and Sandomir and between Ivangorod and
Warsaw. In the first of these attempts
the Russians carefully waited until two
battalions had crossed and then fell on
them with the bayonet, while the rafts
were cruelly raked with rifle-fire. In the
second instance, the enemy were similarly
uninterrupted while throwing their pontoons
across. Then a burst of shrapnel
fell upon the masses as they were in the
act of crossing. The river ran red with
blood, hundreds of corpses floated down
the stream, and but few escaped. On
the following day a tremendous artillery
duel lasted for several hours. The Russians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
got the range and established their
superiority, as was evidenced by the
smoke and flames beginning to rise from
the miserable villages within the enemy’s
position, and by the slackening of his fire.
The scene was one of sublime horror.
The sky for miles was lit up by the blaze
of the burning buildings and by the
myriads of bursting projectiles. It was
the beginning of the end of the invasion
of Russian Poland.</p>

<p>Warsaw itself “returned to the normal”
on October 14. The frightened people
had been a good deal dispirited and disheartened
by what had appeared to them
like a falling-back of their defending
army, and many of them had, indeed,
already fled from the threatened city.
They were further discouraged by the
dissemination of a German proclamation
announcing that the enemy would be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
Warsaw “by the 18th”&mdash;instead of
which, by the date named the Kaiser’s
army was in full retreat. Now, however,
the aspect was brighter. Numbers of
ragged and dejected prisoners (but many
of them Poles) were being brought into
Warsaw daily. Institutions and shops
that had been shut up were reopened.
The utmost animation prevailed where
yesterday there had been pessimism and
dejection. Cheering crowds gave cigarettes,
apples, milk, and bread to the
Russian troops as they marched past with
faces set towards the German frontier.
The agony of Warsaw had endured for
five or six days. All that time the outside
world had watched and waited
without being satisfied, so rigid was the
Russian censorship of news.</p>

<p>If the policy of “waiting for the
enemy” had so far been crowned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
substantial success, much remained to
be achieved. In the densely wooded
country stretching away from the Polish
capital to Petrikau, the fighting had been
particularly deadly, several villages being
taken and retaken. As far as could be
ascertained, the German troops suffering
the most heavily in this quarter were the
17th and 20th Corps. One Russian
regiment alone lost three commanding
officers in rapid succession. The behaviour
of the Siberian troops under fire
was especially gallant and noteworthy.
With trenches full of water and the conditions
generally depressing, these fine
troops held on to one position during
eight days of fighting, sometimes hand
to hand, and always decimated by shell-fire.
This place was swampy ground on
the left bank of the Vistula. It was
known from the prisoners that the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
army detailed for the great movement
upon Warsaw contained many of the
Kaiser’s finest battalions. It was hoped
to smash in the Russian centre while
simultaneously dealing heavy blows both
against Ivangorod and in Galicia. Apart
from its great strategical value, due consideration
was given to the moral results
of the capture of Warsaw.</p>

<p>We have seen in part how this plan
miscarried. I propose now to piece together
a few missing links with the assistance
of one of the longest and most
remarkable despatches sent during the
whole war&mdash;by Mr. Granville Fortescue
to the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>. Mr. Fortescue
suggests, as a starting-point for the
phase when the Germans’ offensive “exhausted
itself” and their complete defeat
became inevitable, October 19-20. Close
pressure upon the enemy’s left wing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
caused the huge front to swing round,
running westerly instead of north and
south. A comparison is made of the
“luring” of the enemy towards Warsaw
with the “luring” of Napoleon’s legions
towards Moscow a century before. For,
says this writer, “the Russians do not
play by the German rules&mdash;they look on
Nature as their first and strongest ally.
With the elements on their side, batteries
of 17-in. howitzers dwindle into insignificance.”
There were stories also of
friction between the high commanders
on the Austro-German side; but as to
this the correspondent could of course
say nothing very definite, particularly
as his information would of necessity be
derived from prejudiced sources. Mr
Fortescue continues:</p>

<p>“On October 20, when the battle of
the Vistula was at its height, the German<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Austrian line of communications
stretched across 150 miles of Russian
territory. On that day the German
attack exhausted itself. The tide of
battle ebbed. The Russian right swept
round, discouraged the enemy, and rolled
him away from the Vistula. Warsaw no
longer trembled under the salvos of the
enemy’s artillery. The Russian cheers
of victory echoed sixty miles away.</p>

<p>“The Germans, battling for the railroad
bridges across the Vistula at Ivangorod,
paused in their fight. In that
pause they could almost hear the tread
of the oncoming Russian legions. At
Radom the Crown Prince and his staff
hastily ordered up reserves to meet this
new menace.</p>

<p>“For four days victory hung in the
balance. Then the German resistance
began to crumble. The force of numbers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
began to tell. At Radom steam was up
on the engine that pulled the Crown
Prince’s private car. Already the German
army which had threatened Warsaw
was in full retreat along the south margin
of the river Pilitza. Under the threat
of attack from this flank the Germans
and Austrians holding the Kosenitze
and Ivangorod front fell back, after
offering a most desperate resistance.
When the troops of the Kosenitze-Ivangorod
line were smashed the German-Austrian
position south along the Vistula,
from Nowa Alexandria to Sandomir,
could no longer hold. On November 5
the main body of the Austrians began
to fall back precipitately. A final effort
made here to dam the Russian tide was
in a manner an heroic waste of force.”</p>

<p>This account is supplemented by the
Russian official report, which conveniently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
divides the two later phases of the
German overthrow into October 23-27,
and October 28 to November 2. In the
first of these phases the enemy battling
in the Kosenizy-Ivangorod zone retreated
on finding himself being outflanked
by way of the river Pilitza.
In the second, the German resistance
along a line Novaya-Alexandria similarly
broke down utterly.</p>

<p>This further retirement found them, a
day or two later, endeavouring to hold
on to the town of Kielce along a forty-mile
line of entrenchments. The Russians
reconnoitred this position by night
and attacked at dawn. A frightful
conflict, often hand to hand, lasted the
whole of a day and night. At last the
defenders were routed with a loss of
2,400 men and 40 officers captured, with
a howitzer, 10 light guns, and 11 machine-guns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
These prisoners belonged to the
20th Corps, the Landwehr, the Guard
Reserve Corps, and the 1st and 2nd
Austrian Corps. Here Austrian and
Prussian fought shoulder to shoulder.</p>

<p>Throughout November 2 the Austrians
were fighting hard for the retention of
the important town of Sandomir on the
Vistula, which they had occupied and
protected with a triple line of entrenchments
and wire entanglements “carrying
alternating electrical current.” The
Russians stormed all three lines by irresistible
bayonet charges. Nevertheless,
in the hope of recovering the works the
defenders brought up heavy reserves
that night; but all in vain&mdash;attack and
counter-attack ending in their total discomfiture
with awful losses. They left
all their sick and wounded behind them,
whom the Russians found, together with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
much booty of all descriptions, on their
victorious entry into Sandomir. In two
days they captured from the Austrians
nearly 5,000 prisoners, 18 field-guns, and
24 machine-guns.</p>

<p>The main German army was now in
such rapid retreat that it was obvious to
all that the scene of operations would
shortly be shifted to their own territory.
It was only possible to guess at the losses
in the three weeks’ Titanic struggle for
the possession of the capital of Russian
Poland and the long line of the Vistula&mdash;losses
which, if vast on the Russian side,
must be reckoned as simply colossal on
that of the Austro-German allies, <em>plus</em>
in their case thousands on thousands of
prisoners and the hundreds of guns taken.</p>

<p>The scheme of the onslaught upon the
Vistula was generally condemned by
critics not only of Russian, but of European<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
repute, it being pointed out that if
the conception of that offensive had been
the avoidance of a battle around Cracow
and on the plains of Silesia, such a conflict
had merely been postponed&mdash;to take
place under circumstances far less favourable
to the German plans. Rightly or
wrongly, General von Hindenburg came
in for not a little of this adverse criticism,
it being pointed out that, although the
report might be correct that the Crown
Prince had been nominally in command,
Von Hindenburg was in all probability
the guiding spirit of the move.</p>

<p>On the other hand, not one but several
of Russia’s military leaders had enormously
increased their reputations. These
included General Russky&mdash;who had led
the masterly advance along the river
Pilitza&mdash;General Ivanoff, and, most of all,
of course, the Grand-duke Nicholas himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
As Mr. Granville Fortescue phrases
it, Nicholas Nicolavitch is a Russian of
the old school. He is known to be a
strict disciplinarian, but “when one
carries the responsibility of one-sixth of
the world on his shoulders one cannot
listen to excuses. In the army he is the
law and the word.” While the prolonged
agony of the Warsaw battles was taking
place the Tsar conferred upon the Grand-duke
that prized decoration the Order of
St. George. Lesser grades in the same
decoration went to his skilful Chief-of-the-Staff,
General Yanuskevitch, and
to Quartermaster-General Daniloff. The
Tsar also similarly rewarded Captain
Martinoff for acts of deep devotion and
gallantry. While not yet recovered from
a wound, this brave man insisted upon
taking over the command of Turret Hill
in the defence of the fortress of Ossovetz,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
where he remained for three days in an
exposed position of the utmost danger
and under a continuous hail of fire. When
a shell dropped close to the magazine and
threatened to blow it up, Martinoff personally
headed a party to the scene
of the danger and extinguished the
flames.</p>

<p>During the time of crisis Warsaw did
not entirely escape the bomb-throwing
from aeroplanes which has been such a
feature of the German aggressive in both
theatres of war. One such messenger of
death (October 19), or, rather, several
such, killed nine and wounded no fewer
than fifty-six of the civilian population,
including several women and children.
Then was witnessed the novel spectacle
of the people mounting the roofs of their
houses and taking “pot-shots” at the
deadly Taube machines, one of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
had been instrumental in killing or maiming
upwards of sixty non-combatants.</p>

<p>It was only natural that victory for the
Russian arms should have enhanced the
already high enthusiasm and patriotism
of the Tsar’s peoples. It was known that
there had long existed in German minds
a profound contempt for the Muscovite
military organisation, Potsdam professors
of war having clung to the belief that
they were opposed to a system which
was faulty and calculated to break down,
especially after the adverse verdict of
the war with Japan in 1904-5. But such
critics had not reckoned with the complete
reorganisation of the Russian military
“machine” carried out in 1910, nor
yet allowed for the vastly improved personnel
of the Russian rank and file. Of
this last-mentioned point, one of the war
correspondents wrote:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“The Russian ‘Tommy,’ or, as he is
called here, Ivan, son of Ivan, is a most
impressive-looking soldier. Nearly all
over 5 ft. 6 in. in height, and of splendid
build, they recall certain Irish regiments
in size and swagger. For as soon as the
peasant has donned the long, light, terra-cotta-coloured
overcoat and learned to
set his cap at a jaunty angle, he assumes
the martial swagger. The Russian military
overcoat is the best bit of soldiers’
wearing apparel I have seen in any army.
Not only is it smart in cut and colour,
but eminently practical. No better protection
against the winter cold could
be devised. I used to think that the
English military overcoat was the best
made; but the Russian is better. It is
not necessary to emphasise the importance
of having a good covering in Russia
in winter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>It was stated, apparently with authority,
that some of the German prisoners
arriving at Vilna were lads of sixteen
years of age. Among stories of “atrocities”
vouched for was one to the
effect that an enemy patrol, having
captured a Cossack trooper, flung the
poor wretch on to a fire and literally
roasted him alive! It was averred that
a Russian officer, doubting the reliability
of the horrible story, caused the charred
remains of the Cossack to be disinterred.
But there were counter-charges of atrocities
preferred against the Russians, and
on both sides some very wild talk on
the subject. In a war of such inveterate
bitterness as this had now become one
must perforce suspend judgment.</p>

<p>The official <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">communiqué</i> upon the
defence of the Vistula and the complete
defeat of the invasion of Russian Poland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
closed with these impressive words: “We
owe thanks for our victory to the unfailing
grace which God has shown to the
superhuman heroism of our warriors,
of whom Russia may be justly proud.
The victory which has been achieved
makes it possible for our troops to set
about the solution of fresh problems, the
grappling with which commences a new
period of the war.”</p>

<p>At Radom&mdash;now in Russian hands
again after a month’s occupation by the
enemy, and where his invasion plan is
supposed to have been perfected&mdash;the
following proclamation to the Polish
inhabitants was issued by the commander
of a Russian army corps: “Poles!
Our wounded officers and soldiers, and
also our prisoners who had fallen into
the hands of the enemy and had passed
through the town and province of Radom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
speak with deep gratitude of your
cordial treatment of them. You have
tended the wounded, fed the starving,
and sheltered from the enemy those
escaping from captivity. You have given
them money, and guided them to our
lines. Accept from me, and from all
ranks of the army entrusted to me, warm
and hearty thanks for all your kindness,
for your Slavonic sympathy and goodness.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class="mediumfont">THE SIEGE OF PRZEMYSL&mdash;THE STRUGGLE
ON THE SAN</span></h2>


<p>“When Przemysl falls,” wrote Mr. Granville
Fortescue in the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>,
“the name of Radko Dimitrieff will ring
around the world.” It was not, however,
the immediate object of General Dimitrieff
and his coadjutors to bring about
a hurried capitulation of this commanding
fortress and its 30,000 defenders. The
Russian headquarters in Galicia could well
afford to play a waiting game and let the
grim business of starvation do its work.</p>

<p>In our <a href="#Page_16">second chapter</a> we brought
down the record of events on the Galician
theatre of war to the important capture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
of Jaroslav by the Russians on September
21, after only three days’ investment.
The Colonel Shumsky from whom I have
already quoted points out the enormous
significance of this capture when taken
in conjunction with the all-round breakdown
of the Austro-German conception.
That plan assumed, he opines that
Western Poland would have been cut
off, and there would have been a last
development of the Austro-German forces
from Jaroslav over Ivangorod and East
Prussia seawards. From “the Baltic to
the Carpathians” was certainly the
grandest of grand conceptions&mdash;instead
of which, we have the well-nigh incredible
estimate of <em>a million</em> Austrian troops put
out of action in less than two months of
war, and the frank statement by one of
their general officers that “the enemy
is too much for us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>It would appear that the Austrian
forces operating along the line Lublin-Holm
in August to September included
the 3rd, 11th, 12th, and portions of the
7th, 13th, and 14th Army Corps, with
five cavalry divisions. But in one day’s
fighting alone they are known to have
had 20,000 casualties, the mobility and
rapidity of the Russian offensive seeming
quite to have paralysed them. After
Lemberg, the capture of Halicz and
later still of Jaroslav rendered their position
still more unenviable. As Professor
Pares points out, “the chief harm which
Germany and Austria could inflict in
a war against Russia was to conquer
Russian Poland, whose frontier made
defence extremely difficult. Regarding
this protuberance as a head, Germany and
Austria could make a simultaneous amputating
operation at its neck, attacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
the one from East Prussia and the other
from Galicia. But the German policy,
which had other and more primary
objects, precipitated war with France
and threw the bulk of the German forces
westward. Thus the German army in
East Prussia kept the defensive, and
Austria was left to make her advance
from Galicia without support.” We have
seen in part how that forlorn advance
was destined to be beaten back in blood.</p>

<p>Perhaps never in the history of war
have more lies, false rumours, and unintelligent
anticipations got into print
than in connection with the momentous
event happening in Galicia consequent
upon the “pleasant surprise” of the
capture of Jaroslav on September 21.
As that important success, taken in conjunction
with the huge battles in East
Prussia and Russian Poland, certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
implied the imminent danger of Przemysl,
we heard all sorts of things about the fate
of that great fortress. It was on the eve
of capture, it was on fire, most of the
forts were taken&mdash;the garrison was driven
to the inner defences, etc., etc. In short,
Przemysl was by the many-headed held
to have been captured, or at all events
isolated, quite early in September. But
the powerful German advance into
Poland, with the co-operating Austrian
movement on their right in Galicia, had
put the fortress for the moment out of
danger. Jaroslav’s fall was a decided
nail in the coffin of Przemysl, but no
more.</p>

<p>This fortress&mdash;whose remarkable orthography
was the subject of a sly little
joke by Mr. Lloyd George in a speech on
the war&mdash;is stated to have been insufficiently
garrisoned (30,000). It has not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
large civil population, and after September
21 the extreme step was taken by the
Commandant of expelling all persons who
had not provisions for a siege of three
months. The retreating Austrians did
not have time to destroy the bridges over
the San, and the almost complete isolation
of Przemysl was rendered more acute by
the announcement that, “as the crow
flies,” the Russian advance-guard was not
more than 135 miles from Cracow itself!
The general line of the Austrian retreat
was mainly towards that famous and
historic city, where the hospitals and
houses were already crowded with their
thousands of wounded. Such a retreat
would link them up to the right wing
of their German allies, when they would
become a more component part of the
Kaiser’s forces. Comparisons were freely
bandied about, in which the energetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Russian pursuit was likened to
Kutusoff’s chase of Napoleon’s Grand
Army in 1812, and to Lee’s pursuit by
Grant in the American Civil War in
1864. In any event, the crumbling
away of the Austrian defence of Galicia
was now so significant as to dwarf minor
considerations.</p>

<p>The retreat towards Cracow was
marked by a good deal of demoralisation
and by the plundering of the estates of
some of the Polish aristocracy. The
capture of the railway junctions of Debica
and Chyrov by the conquering foe further
isolated the threatened fortress, while the
passage of the Carpathians by way of the
Uszok Pass was planting the Russian
army firmly upon Hungarian soil, where
there were no great places of strength
to be reduced. The tables had been
turned with a vengeance, and the invasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of Austro-Hungary was an accomplished
fact. What would Germany do
in face of these changed conditions?
became for a week or so the burning topic
among strategists and lookers-on at the
great game.</p>

<p>Coincident, presumably, with the expulsion
of most of the civil population,
the garrison of Przemysl were placed
upon three-quarter rations. If one thing
was humanly more certain than another
it was that, except by a miracle, relief
could not reach them&mdash;they gleaned as
much from their wireless communications
with the retreating arm, the Russians
not having yet succeeded in destroying
the wireless station.</p>

<p>Late September and the first part of
October was occupied by the Russians
in the two main directions of pressing
with great masses of troops the Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
retreat towards Cracow, and in
completing with slow but sure tenacity
the investment of Przemysl, where the
thousands of mouths to feed were now
placed upon half instead of three-quarter
rations. A series of sanguinary combats
went on almost uninterruptedly with the
beaten Austrians, who always fought
bravely enough, but invariably continued
their retirement with heavy losses in men
and material of war. The great events
in Russian Poland already narrated were
naturally exercising their indirect influence
in this quarter.</p>

<p>Professor Pares was privileged to visit
the Galician battle-fields in October, and
his impressions are of all the more interest
from the fact that we have little else
save scrappy official reports to go upon.
Mr. Pares visited Galich, Stryl, and Rava-Ruska,
and of the latter place he writes:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>“Our visit to Rava-Ruska presented
much greater military interest; we drove
round the south, east, and north front
of the Russian attack on this little town
and very valuable explanations were
given by an able officer of the General
Staff. On the southern front near the
station of Kamionka Woloska, where
there were lines of trenches, the deep
holes made by bursting Russian shells,
and sometimes filled with water, lay
thick together.</p>

<p>“The eastern front was more interesting.
Here there were many lines of
rifle-pits, Austrian, Russian, or Austrian
converted into Russian. The Austrian
rifle-pits were much shallower and less
finished than the Russian, which were
generally squarer, deeper, and with
higher cover. An officer’s rifle-pit just
behind those of his men showed their care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and work, as was indicated in letters
written just after the battle. Casques
of cuirassiers, many Hungarian knapsacks,
broken rifles, fragments of shrapnel,
potatoes pulled up, and even such oddments
as an Austrian picture postcard,
were to be found in or near the rifle-pits.</p>

<p>“These wide plains, practically without
cover, were reminiscent of Wagram.
A high landmark was a crucifix, on
which one of the arms of the figure was
shot away; underneath it was a ‘brothers’
grave,’ containing the bodies of
120 Austrians and twenty-one Russians.
Another cross of fresh-cut wood marked
the Russian soldiers’ tribute to an officer:
‘God’s servant, Gregory.’ Close to one
line of trenches stood a village absolutely
untouched, and in the fields between
stood a picturesque group of villagers at
their field-work, one in an Austrian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
uniform and two boys in Austrian
shakos.”</p>

<p>He noted that cavalry had played but
an inconspicuous part in this desperate
fighting. The Russians, he says, were
always attacking. They felt the supremest
confidence in the power of their
artillery (“though the proportion of
field-guns to a unit is less numerous on
the Russian side than on the German or
Austrian”), and, when questioned as to
the enemy’s rifle-fire, they would reply,
in characteristic Tommy Atkins fashion,
“Oh, nothing striking.” Many men told
Mr. Pares that they did not believe the
Austro-German liked fighting at close
quarters with the bayonet as much as the
Russians did. The one thing for which
the latter felt respect was the hostile
heavy artillery, though claiming that
their own field-artillery was superior.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
Their extraordinary endurance in the
trenches, and their calm resolution and
unswerving belief in their own prowess
and the justness of their cause impressed
him profoundly.</p>

<p>This commentator felt compelled, however
reluctantly, to bear witness to the
brutality of the retreating Austrians to
the Polish peasantry. Of this he saw
numerous examples, as also instances of
the people’s retaliation upon the enemy,
such as the wholesale destruction of the
Austrian General Desveaux’s beautiful
chateau. Little things will stick in the
mind, and Mr. Pares noted amid the
ruins of this noble house a map of the
Austrian army manœuvres of 1893,
“twenty years after.” The Russians
deemed themselves among friends when
they mingled with the Ruthenian inhabitants
of Galicia, speaking their language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
and treating them with all good fellowship.
The invaders’ relations with the
Jewish population were scarcely so amicable
in all cases.</p>

<p>Another correspondent of a great newspaper
who had the harrowing experience
of traversing some of the battle-fields of
Galicia after the Austrian breakdown
presents the following vivid and touching
picture:</p>

<p>“In the very centre of this zone of
misery two roads intersect, and at the
angle stands a huge wooden cross on
which hangs the carved figure of the
Saviour. For a hundred years, no doubt,
this monument to brotherly love has
hung above the cross-roads so that the
pious might pause in their journey to
cross themselves and mutter a prayer.
Nothing could be more incongruous than
to see this sacred emblem: the mute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
evidence of a religious people. The top
of the wooden upright is shattered by a
bullet, while one arm of the figure of
Jesus has been carried away by a shrapnel
shell. What, indeed, must have been
the thoughts of the patient Austrians
lying in their exposed position and dying
in hundreds as they beheld the shot
and shell bursting about the carved
figure of Him whose work on earth
was to spread peace and brotherly love!
The patient face of the Christ looks down
upon a newly made grave wherein lie
the shattered remains of 124 men who
died almost at the foot of the sacred
figure.”</p>

<p>For the defence of Przemysl many
thousands of workmen were impressed
to assist in the work of strengthening
the fortifications, being called in from
the neighbouring villages under threat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
of extreme penalties. The quantity of
ammunition in the place was enormous,
but the shortage of provisions is claimed
by the Russians as being due to the swiftness
of their initiative, whereby great
quantities of stores intended for the
defending force had been captured.
The investing army had now a large
number of batteries in position, and
though they could well afford to take
things easily so as to avoid needless
wastage of life, the progress made was
steady. German, and not Austrian,
leadership was directing the defence of
the stronghold. Every effort was made
by them to hearten their men into the
belief that the combined Austro-German
operations proceeding towards the river
San might, and in all likelihood would,
culminate in the relief of the place. On
this point, and of the operations in Galicia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
generally, Colonel Shumsky wrote during
the second week of October:</p>

<p>“All the attempts of the enemy to
cross the San have ended in a miserable
fiasco. The Austro-German forces are
making their attempts at various points
of the river. First the artillery deluges
the right shore with shells, and then
infantry detachments approach the river;
but Russian shrapnel causes them enormous
losses. Dead bodies are washed
down the San to the Vistula, and on to
Sandomir and Ivangorod.</p>

<p>“Before this fortress the battle continues
day and night without a moment’s
intermission. The Germans are giving
the defence a very energetic character.
To all appearances the fortress is well
supplied with ammunition. Our troops
are making a gradual but persistent
attack. Sometimes a regiment becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
impatient with the slowness of the progress
and storms the nearest line of
works. Sometimes a sharp blow,
delivered in the night, brings about
the fall of a strong fort. In this way
several works have been taken.</p>

<p>“These unexpected blows clearly
greatly excite the garrison. Right
through the night projectors search the
battle-field, and their long white rays rest
tremulously on every fold of the ground.
At times something alarms the forts, and
the air is instantly filled with the thunder
of roused Austrian guns. The fire is then
kept up for thirty minutes to an hour
before it again subsides.”</p>

<p>He adds that “the tremendous strategic
front becomes elongated just as it
does in France.” This immense battle-line
was now beginning to be known to the
strategists as the line “Cracow-Przemysl-Thorn,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
as it began to be growingly
obvious that Austrian Cracow and
Silesian Thorn would presently be the
scene of the biggest operations of the
conflicting Empires.</p>

<p>On October 13-14 great Austro-German
columns were in touch with their enemy
south-east of Sandomir and west of
Przemysl. On the first of the dates
named an Austrian force deploying by
way of Samok-Lisko upon Sambor was
hurled back with the loss of 7 officers
and 500 men captured, and next day
they lost several hundred more prisoners.
Hitherto the success of the Russian arms
in Galicia had been so continuous that the
official despatches and the newspaper
reports in the Petrograd papers were
fairly representative of the facts, patriotic
feeling experiencing no temptation to
practise a diplomatic “economy of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
truth.” But now we find it hard to
reconcile the Petrograd reports with
reliable information from other sources
as to what was happening in the region
of the San.</p>

<p>The news that came from Petrograd,
directly or through Rome and Paris,
told of repeated victories over the Austrians
on the San. But it would seem
that these reports were only repetitions
of news already sent, and referred to the
opening stage of the fighting with the
Austrian advance on Von Hindenburg’s
extreme right.</p>

<p>There appears to be no doubt that the
peril of Warsaw and the need of drawing
heavy reinforcements from Galicia to
assist in repelling the German invasion
of Poland and then in following up the
enemy’s retirement, led to the army on
the San being so weakened for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
moment that all it could do was to hold
its own for a while about Sandomir, near
the junction of the San and the Vistula.
In doing this it rendered a solid service
to the Grand-duke Nicholas, as it prevented
the line of the Vistula being turned
above Ivangorod.</p>

<p>But something had to be sacrificed to
secure this result. Jaroslav was abandoned
for the moment, and reoccupied by
the Austrians, and the siege of Przemysl
was raised. There was a day of enthusiastic
rejoicing when the relieving
column marched into the hard-pressed
and half-starved city. Received at the
gates by the civil and ecclesiastical
authorities, the troops marched amidst
cheering crowds to the town hall, where
General von Kusmanek, the commander
of the fortress, stood waiting to greet
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Even more welcome than the battle-grimed
soldiers was the long convoy of
supply wagons that they escorted.
The garrison and the people could again
enjoy an unstinted meal, and looked
forward to a long respite from the trials
they had endured. But the military
authorities had no illusions in the outlook.
Przemysl had hardly been relieved when
bad news came from the scene of the
great battles in Central Poland, and
the pressure of the Russian forces began
to be felt at once, for on the news of the
Grand-duke’s success against Von Hindenburg
they at once abandoned their
attitude of stubborn defence for a vigorous
offensive. It was realised that
Przemysl might soon be once more ringed
round with fire and steel, so steps were
taken to prepare for a new siege. Supplies
of all kinds were poured into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
place by day and by night, the control
of the junction at Jaroslav facilitating this
revictualling operation. At the same
time some thousands of the non-combatant
population were sent away so as to
reduce the number of “useless mouths”
to a minimum. In a week Przemysl was
ready to defend itself again, and to face
a siege under greatly improved conditions.</p>

<p>The work had indeed to be interrupted
before Von Kusmanek had done all he
hoped to accomplish. For the retreat
of Von Hindenburg in the centre was at
once followed by the column that had
attacked Ivangorod returning through
Radom. The whole invasion was collapsing
and the Austrian position on the
San had become untenable. Petrograd
could now resume a true record of Galician
victories, as the retiring enemy fought a
series of rearguard actions each of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
ended in the capture of Austrian prisoners
by the pursuing columns of the Russian
left.</p>

<p>But before telling of the closing scenes
of Von Hindenburg’s ambitious effort to
overrun the country of the Vistula and
clear Galicia of the Russian armies, as a
result of his hoped-for success, we must
note some characteristic aspects of the
campaign that reveal the special characteristics
of the Russian soldier and his
leaders. These will bring out something
of the human interest of the war better
even than the story of marches and
battles and strategical combinations.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class="mediumfont">STORIES FROM THE FIGHTING LINE</span></h2>


<p>The Austrian Army in these Polish campaigns
suffered under the serious disadvantage
that, amongst the various nationalities
serving in it, there were many
men whose sympathies were with the
enemy, or whose hearts were not on the
Austrian side. The Slav soldiers felt
they were fighting against their brother
Slavs of Russia, and there were also in
the Austrian army in Galicia Italian regiments
from the Venetian border about
Trieste and Fiume. It was a sagacious
move on the part of the Tsar’s Government
to make an offer in the first stage
of the campaign to Italy “as an evidence
of his friendship and sympathy,” to
liberate and send to Italy all prisoners of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
Italian nationality taken in Galicia, on
condition that the Italian Government
would engage not to send them back
to Austria. To this the Italian Prime
Minister, Signor Salandra, formally replied
that the rules of international
law prohibited his acceptance of the offer.
Commenting upon this, the Rome semi-official
<cite>Messaggero</cite> remarked that, “Whatever
Signor Salandra’s answer may be,
the Italian people are grateful to the Tsar,
whose generous humanitarian proposal
contains also the official, solemn, and precise
affirmation that Russia recognises
the right of Italy to the Italian provinces
that are still under Austrian rule.”</p>

<p>General Rennenkampf took with him
into East Prussia, as a kind of mascot
or symbol that should be prophetic of the
signal success ultimately destined to
crown the Muscovite arms, the identical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
flag carried by the celebrated Skobelev
on his momentous campaign of 1877.
A small thing in itself, this was well
calculated to make a direct appeal to the
impressionable Slav temperament, to the
young men who had heard from their
fathers of the wonderful “White General”
who in the great days of Plevna and the
Balkans was perhaps more responsible
than any other single factor for the triumph
of the Cross over the Crescent.</p>

<p>It was an incident characteristic of the
pervading spirit, and one well calculated
to stimulate it. But there were thousands
of incidents and scenes that have
perforce to be dismissed in a line, or even
not referred to at all. Among the many
gallant spirits marked out for special
distinction of the Tsar was the Captain
Pleshkoff whose superb horsemanship
had been acclaimed year after year at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
Olympia Horse Show in London, where
as recently as 1914 he carried off the
King Edward VII Cup. Captain Pleshkoff
received a nasty wound in one of
the cavalry combats around Warsaw. He
is a Cossack by descent, a pupil of the
famous General Brussiloff, and is noted
among his admiring countrymen as the
“inventor” of a new system of riding. The
captain shared the fate of most reformers
when he attempted to bring his riding
method to the notice of his colonel, an old-fashioned
martinet commanding the Tsar’s
Life Guard Cuirassiers. In fact, it led
to Pleshkoff’s temporary severance from
his beloved regiment when he became
adjutant to one of the Grand-duke’s; but
on the outbreak of the present struggle
he returned to the Life Guard Cuirassiers.</p>

<p>But there are so many men of Pleshkoff’s
stamp among the Tsar’s eight millions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
of fighters that his Imperial master
might well be tempted to say, with a
great leader of the past, “If I made all
my brave soldiers generals, there wouldn’t
be any privates left.” Such a one was
the wounded warrior who averred, with
crystalline sincerity and self-confidence,
that if he had not been laid aside by a
bullet the campaign for Russian Poland
would have been a much more brief affair!</p>

<p>A parallel story to one coming from
the western theatre of war&mdash;of the young
girl who, by assuming masculine attire,
managed to be accepted for service with
the Flying Corps&mdash;is that of a young
Russian lady who managed to smuggle
herself into a cavalry regiment leaving
for the front. Not only so, but this
young Amazon, in addition to bearing
herself bravely in the field&mdash;she was a
fine horsewoman&mdash;assisted a trooper in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
rescuing a wounded comrade. The secret
of her sex was only discovered when, a
few days later, she herself was wounded.
Again, two lads about fifteen years of
age escaped from their parents’ home in
Moscow, and, following the fortunes of a
regiment belonging to that ancient city,
were present at half a dozen battles of
Rennenkampf’s campaign in East Prussia,
“crawling on their stomachs with
reserves of ammunition to the firing
line.” Apparently these adventurous
boys escaped unscathed.</p>

<p>A story with a delightful flavour of the
hoax running through it was communicated
during October by the Petrograd
correspondent of the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>. It
betrays a sense of Slavonic humour which,
it is to be hoped, was not entirely lost
upon the victims of the ruse:</p>

<p>“A Russian airman, accompanied by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
an observation officer, was flying over the
enemy’s territory, when he was obliged
to descend, owing to engine trouble. The
pilot and the officer were wearing leather
clothes, without any distinctive mark.
They were working on the motor when
suddenly seven Austrian soldiers, in charge
of an under-officer, appeared over the crest
of a little hill and approached them. Resistance
was impossible, for the Russians
had no weapons but revolvers. Fortunately,
the officer knew German. Calling
loudly to the Austrian officer, he ordered
him, in a peremptory manner, to come and
help him mend the motor. The Austrian,
believing he was in the presence of a
superior officer, hastened with his men to
obey, and soon the engine had been put
right. The aeroplane started off, and as
it ascended in spirals to the clouds a paper
fell at the feet of the gaping Austrians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
It contained a short message of thanks
to the officer and his men for giving such
timely aid to Russian aviators.”</p>

<p>At the time of General Rennenkampf’s
severe reverse near Soldau after his first
brilliant incursion into East Prussia,
it had been generally inferred that the
brave General Samsonoff and other leading
officers had been killed in the practical
surrounding of a large Russian force of
two army corps. A gleam came out of
the fog of war when it was semi-officially
announced that this was not the case.
It was the deadly explosion of a chance
shell that killed General Samsonoff,
General Martos, and other officers of the
Staff. The former was particularly beloved
by his men, but he had a fatal
facility for exposing his life unduly and
recklessly. In reply to all remonstrances
he would simply say, “My place is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
where my soldiers are”&mdash;and to this
trait, not less than to his care for the
comfort of his men, was due the remarkable
popularity that he enjoyed among
the rank and file. No officer was more
universally regretted on the Russian side.</p>

<p>The Tsar took the unusual but intensely
popular course of conferring all
four Classes of the Order of St. George,
the Russian Victoria Cross, upon a humble
trooper of Hussars. This man&mdash;a type
of the many who honestly cannot see that
they have done anything out of the common
in performing a deed of the purest
and most unselfish heroism&mdash;was orderly
to an officer. The latter fell dangerously
wounded, when this brave fellow rescued
him from a storm of shot and carried him
a distance of <em>four miles</em>. During that
long and wearisome tramp with his helpless
burden the soldier had to dodge the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
enemy’s patrols a number of times.
Not only so, but in their path lay several
canals, all of which he swam, supporting
his officer in the water as best he could.</p>

<p>Another soldier, brought into the field-hospital
at Druskeniki, had received
<em>twenty-four bullets</em> in his legs. He was
not aware that many of them had even
struck him&mdash;an intensely interesting
point this, and not wholly unreminiscent
of Mr. Winston Churchill’s testimony of
his and others’ experience in the great Dervish
rush at Omdurman, when they were
scarcely conscious of wounds or of tumult.
Well, when this Russian soldier recovered
consciousness after having one of his feet
torn off, he found himself lying in a
depression of the ground, with shrapnel
and rifle-bullets whistling over him.
The undulating ground unquestionably
saved him from death, as six bullets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
passed through his pail and four through
his water-bottle! He lay thus for some
twenty-four hours before being discovered
and carried into safety, having spent this
agonising period in praying for a passing
projectile to put an end to his sufferings.</p>

<p>A visitor to the scene of the desperately
sustained struggle for the line of
the river San points to the melancholy
fact that at one point alone where 200,000
men were locked in a death-grapple for
upwards of a week (numbers larger than
those engaged either at Gettysburg or
Waterloo), the name of the wretched little
village would not be known to one in a
thousand who looked at the map. Yet
the reaper Death found fearful employment
during those seven or eight days
of pitiless slaughter. “At the summit of
and just beyond the crest of the hill is
the line where stood the Austrian artillery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
in their efforts to encounter the hell
of heavier fire let loose on them by the
Russians. The heaps of brass cartridge-cases
show how stubbornly the Austrians
contested this ridge. Here and there
one sees where a big shell landed true.
Splinters and bits of wheels scattered in
every direction spell the end of this particular
gun-crew. Behind this the Austrians
seem to have had a cavalry support
of some kind, for in a little hollow just
over the ridge we come upon a mass of
cavalry accoutrements. The large metal
helmets of the Austrian dragoons are
scattered everywhere, some of them
twisted by bits of shell, others punctured
with the single bullet-hole which, coupled
with the deep brown stain on the inside,
tells what happened to the unfortunate
who owned it. We find one on which the
name and regiment of the wearer is written,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
a name no doubt that when published as
among the dead will bring misery and suffering
to some home in the beautiful valley
of the Danube, where even now perhaps
the wife or mother anxiously awaits news
of this very one who sleeps now in a great
trench with hundreds of his fellows.”</p>

<p>It is a relief to turn momentarily from
such scenes of horror and bloodshed to
the humorous aspect&mdash;grimly so, perhaps,
but none the less humorous&mdash;of
war. Thus, for example, there is something
of a Gilbertian touch about the
“interchange” of the Kaiser’s hunting-box
and the Tsar’s hunting-box (the
latter’s at Spala, near Tomascheff) in the
two Polands. The Russians appear to
have seized upon the one and the Germans
upon the other, and to have thoroughly
despoiled them. Still on the
grimly humorous side (“the hostilities in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Poland are taking on a very embittered and
cruel form,” he says), the <cite>Daily Telegraph’s</cite>
Petrograd correspondent tells of the form
of receipt(!) that the German troops would
leave with the ignorant peasantry after
commandeering all sorts of supplies. Two
such written acknowledgments which
were shown to the correspondent ran:
“I am much obliged to you for your
beautiful horse,” and “Whoever presents
this at the end of the war will be hanged.”</p>

<p>This same <cite>Telegraph</cite> correspondent
states in definite terms of the Russians
that “looting and licence are unknown,
and everything taken is paid for in hard
cash. They are welcomed as deliverers
by the Polish peasantry, who bring them
refreshments and cigarettes, for which
payment is refused.”</p>

<p>A hundred German cavalry entered
the town of Turburg on September 29.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
They quartered themselves at the mansion
of a prominent member of the Duma,
M. Vasilchikoff, ill-treated his servants,
and demanded 250 buckets(!) of brandy,
beer, and schnapps. They then cleared the
little town of all food and clothing, leaving
slips of paper on which was scribbled,
“The Russian Government will pay.”
They wound up by carrying off a priest
and the local Rabbi as hostages of war.</p>

<p>Another hundred German cavalry encountered
twenty Russian cavalry, who
incontinently fled with the loss of one
wounded. As he lay on the ground,
still able to use his carbine, he took careful
aim and picked off three of the pursuing
Prussians. The peasantry would
have carried the wounded trooper to
safety, but he resolutely replied, “No!
I will never hide from Germans.” For
this he paid with his life, for the enemy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
who had abandoned their pursuit of his
comrades because his good shooting had
made them suspect an ambush, returned
and promptly shot him dead. It is only
fair to add that on an occasion when the
Russians discovered that a number of
peasants had been hanged by the enemy,
they retaliated by hanging from trees
three German officers and nineteen men.
Of such acts of savage reprisal there are
doubtless numerous unrecorded instances.</p>

<p>An “iron vineyard” is the slightly
decorative description applied to a German
position during the holocaust of
Russian Poland, by a Russian War Correspondent
who was not permitted to
indicate the precise spot from which he
was writing. He adds the grisly comment
that the “vintage” of that iron
vineyard was the blood of 6,000 German
soldiers. The surrounding forests had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
been razed as if shaved by a gigantic
razor. A large village that had occupied
the scene of this unnamed battle had
totally disappeared, as having proved
an obstacle to the Russian advance and
a support for the German retreat.</p>

<p>One of the episodes inseparable from a
warfare in which members of the Royal
Families of every one of the great Powers
are playing a soldier’s part, took place
on October 11. On that day Prince
Olaf, son of the Grand-duke Constantine,
received a wound in the leg “in a successful
skirmish with a German patrol.” At
first it was regarded hopefully as being
but a trifling injury, but an operation
became necessary and the young Prince
died, pneumonia doubtless supervening.
He passed away in the presence of the
Grand-duke and Duchess and of his
brother, Prince Igor. It is one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
bitterest ironies of war that this gifted
young man’s leanings and aspirations had
always been rather literary and musical
than martial. At the Lyceum, which
he left only in 1913, he enjoyed such a
brilliant career as a student that his tutors
did their best to dissuade him from overtaxing
a constitution never too robust.
He published an essay on the works of
Pushkin which was acclaimed as a model
of discerning and discriminating criticism.
Prince Olaf’s natural inclinations were
of the simplest kind, and he hated the
rigidity of etiquette.</p>

<p>An author much admired by him, the
Polish novelist Sinciewitz, took service
with the Tsar’s Army. Apparently he
was wounded and taken prisoner, though
there seems still some confusion as to
what really happened to him.</p>

<p>Had the Austrians in Galicia fared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
better or worse than their opponents
believed they would at the outset? A
difficult question to answer off-hand, but
at all events the Russians had the best of
reasons to be thoroughly delighted with
the progress of the Tsar’s arms in three
months of war, in the earlier stages of
which the plucky Serbian resistance to the
legions of Francis Joseph had proved of
considerable utility. Says a well-informed
critic of the Russo-Austrian campaign:</p>

<p>“Success at the outset of a campaign
has an influence of the highest value upon
the armies engaged. In this case the
Russians had the prospect of securing
fairly easy victories at the outset, and,
at the very least, the certainty of being
able to march far into hostile territory
without having any very serious obstacle
to overcome. It was not likely that the
German armies, weakened as they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
by the very conditions under which the
war opened, would attempt any stubborn
resistance in advance of the line of fortresses
along the lower Vistula and at
the extremities of the Frisches Haff. And
it was quite certain that the Austrians
would not make any prolonged resistance
in Eastern Galicia. Their first serious
stand would not be met until the neighbourhood
of Przemysl was reached.”</p>

<p>A caustic criticism of British as compared
with Russian effort in the world-war
came from Petrograd about the
end of October. It was pointed out that,
although the Muscovite Empire might
represent about one-sixth the area of the
whole world, and although the Russian
census papers were circulated in seventy
languages, Great Britain reckoned three
times as many subjects as her Ally. Yet
what had Great Britain done by comparison?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Her fighting force in the field
represented not more than 5 per cent.
of the total battling against the might
of Germany and Austria. “This may be
Government of a kind,” added the critic,
whose subsequent remarks appeared to
have proved too strong for the censor.
He went on to complain of the colossal
ignorance of Russia and Russian ideals
possessed by this country, and entered
an earnest plea for a more intelligent comprehension
of existing conditions than at
present obtaining. It is unquestionably
true that Englishmen of all classes have
still a great deal to unlearn concerning the
Empire but for whose energetic and magnificently
self-sacrificing initiative the
crushing of German militarism would not
have become a practically assured result.</p>

<p>Russia, it is added, has much to teach
us; but <em>not the Russia known in England</em>.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class="mediumfont">THE GERMAN RETREAT AND THE RUSSIAN
PURSUIT TO THE FRONTIER</span></h2>


<p>At the beginning of November, just three
months after the declaration of war,
it seemed that the German invasion of
Poland had ended in complete failure
and that the battle before Warsaw
would be decisive of the whole conflict
in Eastern Europe.</p>

<p>In August, while the Russian mobilisation
was still incomplete, Rennenkampf
had made his daring raid into East
Prussia, with the view of helping the
Allies in the west by forcing Germany to
retain a large army for her own defence
in the east. Though the invaders had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
been defeated by Von Hindenburg in the
great battle of Tannenberg, or Osterode,
and expelled from the invaded province,
the indirect object of the raid had been
obtained.</p>

<p>September had brought victory for
Russia on both wings of the long battle-line.
On the right, or northern wing,
Rennenkampf, after fighting a series of
rearguard actions in the frontier forest
about Augustovo, had retired behind the
Niemen, where he was largely reinforced,
and repulsed the rash attempt of the
Germans to follow him up and force the
crossing of the Niemen. After this
Rennenkampf had driven the Germans
back to their own frontier, and was
again threatening East Prussia with
invasion. On the left, or southern wing,
the Austrian defence of Eastern Galicia
had collapsed and her army had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
driven from the Vistula. Lemberg, the
capital of Galicia, had been occupied, the
line of the river San had been forced,
Jaroslav captured, and Przemysl besieged.
On the extreme Russian left raids had
been made through the passes of the
Carpathians into Northern Hungary, and
from the left bank of the San an army
was advancing to attack Cracow.</p>

<p>At the beginning of October two-thirds
of Galicia had been overrun. In Central
Poland the Russian armies were advancing
in three directions. North of the
Vistula an army was moving towards
Thorn. On the other bank of the great
river a central column moving towards
the frontiers of the province of Posen
had reached the valley of the Warthe.
On the left centre a third force on the
Upper Warthe was approaching the
frontiers of Silesia; but subsequent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
events during this same month showed,
as we have seen, that the forces thus
pushed forward from the Russian centre
towards the German frontier line were
little more than a strong screen or outpost
line, while the main mass of the
central forces was still concentrated on
the Middle Vistula, and in the triangle
of fortresses above Warsaw.</p>

<p>In the second week of October came
Von Hindenburg’s great invasion of
Russian Poland. The dash for Warsaw
was evidently intended to relieve the
pressure of the enemy on Eastern Prussia
and on Galicia by forcing him to draw in
troops from the wings to strengthen the
centre at this critical moment.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the Germans partly
obtained this result. Their advancing
force drove in the Russian detachments
in Western Poland, and the Grand-duke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Nicholas withdrew part of the army
operating in Galicia to assist in the defence
of the Upper Vistula near Ivangorod.
The result was that the Austrians
were able to reoccupy Jaroslav
and to raise the siege of Przemysl for a
while. Then came the days of hard
fighting along the San and the Vistula,
in which the Russians not only held their
own, but, making a counter-attack in
force near Warsaw, broke through the
German centre and compelled a general
retreat of the invaders.</p>

<p>This movement began in the third
week of October, and it is quite evident
that, though defeated, the German
armies and their Austrian Allies were
neither demoralised by their failure nor
broken up by the Russian counter-attack.
From day to day they showed an energy
and tenacity to which it would be unfair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
to refuse the fullest praise. The retreat
was a slow retirement, in which each day
there was a series of hard-fought rearguard
actions. The great battle-line
was now surging westward across the
Polish plain, but every step of the way
was to be disputed. On October 24
stern fighting that gradually assumed
the character and dimensions of another
continuous battle or series of sanguinary
combats was proceeding for the possession
of this frontier. The front extended
roughly for about a hundred versts, or
sixty-six miles, from Rawa to the south
of the river Iljanke. The roads leading
to Radom and Petrikau were the scene
of particularly close and bloody fighting.
North of Rawa the Russian infantry
established a marked superiority with
the bayonet. In one miserable village
(Motchidlo) they buried seven hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
German dead. Four hundred more were
accounted for (captured) south-east of
Rawa, and two batteries of quick-firers
were taken at bayonet-point in the
vicinity of Kazimerjefu.</p>

<p>Much of this fighting took place over
marshy forest-lands, and in weather so
bad that the guns often sank to their
axles. The forest of Nemglovo was occupied
by the Russian advanced troops.
More artillery and prisoners were gathered
in along the shocking roads leading
to Novo Alexandrovo. Indeed, a Russian
official report claimed the substantial
acquisition, during this stern forest-fighting
on October 24-26, of 3,000 men and
50 officers as prisoners, and 8 guns
and numerous quick-firers.</p>

<p>Many gallant counter-attacks along the
ever-widening front were repulsed with
heavy slaughter. At any given point,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
the Russians appear generally to have
possessed a preponderance of numbers,
while the sense of victory kept the men
in thoroughly good heart. The last days
of October and first days of November
saw nothing save the same succession of
hard-fought rearguard actions. On November
7 Russian Poland had been
almost cleared of the invaders, and at
more than one point the Tsar’s vanguards
had crossed the German frontier.
On the right Rennenkampf was again
entering the East Prussian lake region
near Lyck. On the right centre north of
the Vistula, from Lomza to within a few
miles of the fortress of Thorn, the Russians
were close up to the frontier, driving
the German left before them through the
marshy forest region of Northern Poland.
In the centre the frontier of the Prussian
province of Posen had been passed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
the Cossacks south of Thorn. In South-western
Poland the Germans and Austrians
were still retiring through Russian
territory; but they had abandoned Lodz
and Kielce, and it was generally expected
that their retreat would only stop at
Cracow and on the Upper Oder about
Breslau. On the extreme Russian left
the Austrians had been forced back
half way to Cracow, Jaroslav had been
reoccupied by General Brussiloff, and
Przemysl was again besieged.</p>

<p>During the retreat through Poland the
Germans, under cover of their fighting
rear-guards, had very thoroughly wrecked
the railways, and done considerable
damage to the few paved highways of
the district. This work of destruction
was evidently carried out deliberately by
order of Von Hindenburg and the Headquarter
Staff. A large force of engineers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
must have been used to effect it, and
an enormous quantity of explosives
employed in the work. Along the railways
every station had been thoroughly
wrecked. The buildings were burned,
the rails torn up at all the junctions,
curves, and crossings&mdash;the points at
which the relaying of the line would require
special material&mdash;the water-towers
for the locomotives had been blown
up, and all signals thrown down and
telegraph apparatus destroyed or removed.
On both railways and roads
every bridge had been blown up, and the
roads themselves had been very seriously
damaged in a way that showed that a
very large number of men must have
been employed in the work of destruction.
The metalled or paved surface of the
roads had been broken up with the help
of explosives, the surface being destroyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
not always from side to side of the road,
but checker-fashion. Patches of the
pavement being alternately destroyed on
the left and the right side of the roadway,
where explosives had been freely used,
the road had thus become a kind of zig-zag
line of yawning craters. This wrecking
of the roads and railways seriously delayed
the Russian pursuit, for the country,
twice traversed by large armies, had
been exhausted of what supplies it could
afford, and the Grand-duke had to feed
his troops during the pursuit by bringing
up everything he needed from Warsaw
and the Middle Vistula region.</p>

<p>At the time the impression given by
this wholesale destruction of the means
of communication in Western Poland was
that Von Hindenburg and the German
Staff had definitely abandoned all hope
of renewing the invasion. It was argued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
that, if they intended to make another
attempt to seize Warsaw, they might
indeed have done such partial damage to
the railways as would delay the Russian
pursuit, but they would not have thus
thoroughly destroyed them at the cost of
an enormous expenditure of time and
labour. If they meant to invade the
country again in any force the railways
would be a necessity to them. The destruction
of the lines seemed therefore
to be a counsel of despair, and it was
expected that the next phase of the campaign
would be the defence by the Germans
of their fortified frontier-line.</p>

<p>So persuaded was the Russian Headquarter
Staff that the German offensive
had definitely come to an end, that preparations
were made in the first days of
November for the attack on the frontier
fortresses of Germany. The programme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
for the next phase of the campaign was
that on the left the advance in Galicia
was to be pressed up to Cracow, and, once
that place was invested, there was to be
a march from the left and left centre into
Silesia. The invasion of that province,
one of the great industrial regions of
Germany, would be a heavy blow to the
Kaiser, and at the same time a menace
to his Austrian Ally, for through Silesia
lies the easiest way from Russian Poland
to Vienna itself. Between the western
end of the Carpathians and the mass of
hills that form the mountain-lands of
Northern Moravia and Bohemia there is
a stretch of lower ground forming a wide
hollow running south-westward from the
Upper Oder region towards Vienna. This
valley has often in the past seen the
march of armies towards the Austrian
capital. Thus, for instance, it was by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
this line that the Russian armies, then
allied with Austria, marched south-westward
in 1805. The object of the march
was to occupy Vienna, then held by
Napoleon, and the adventure ended unsuccessfully
at Austerlitz.</p>

<p>On the right the Russian armies were
to continue the new invasion of East
Prussia, and in the centre there was to be
a direct menace to Berlin by an attempt
to break through the frontier fortress-line.
The railways were being partly
repaired, and a siege-train was about to
be moved up from Warsaw against Thorn,
the point selected for the first attack,
because the possession of it would give
the Russians command of the Lower
Vistula.</p>

<p>The fortress of Thorn is situated within
five miles of the frontier on both banks
of the river and is the junction for five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
railway lines. Thus the Germans could
operate on both sides of the great river.
It may be said to dominate all the highways
between East Prussia and the rest
of Germany. In conjunction with the
lesser, but still imposing fortresses of
Kulm, Fordan, and Graudenz, it forms
the pivot for an army acting on the
defensive on the line of the Vistula.
Since the opening weeks of the war six
thousand labourers had been engaged
night and day in strengthening Thorn’s
defences.</p>

<p>A thousand fortress-guns and nine
great forts, the latter named after Teutonic
rulers and leaders, constitute its
main armament. They are thus described
by the Russian Colonel Shumsky:</p>

<p>“The defence works of Thorn comprise
nine main forts&mdash;Scharnhorst, Yorck,
Bülow, Wilhelm II., Heinrich von Zalzie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Grosser Kurfürst, Hertzog, Albrecht,
Friedrich der Grosse, and Dohna. Between
these forts there are seven intermediate
works, which are separated by
distances of from half to three-quarters
of a mile. In consequence of the short
distances separating the forts, a most
destructive cross-fire can be obtained
from them.</p>

<p>“The forts are distant between three-quarters
of a mile and a mile from the
outskirts of the town, which is accordingly
within easy reach of the shells of the
attacking force. The forts are connected
in their rear by a circular highway, on
which are sixteen infantry barracks and
twenty-eight subterranean magazines.
To this road there radiate from the town
numerous sunk ways, masked with turf.</p>

<p>“The advanced positions before Thorn
are a mile from the forts on the right bank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of the river. The armament of the fortress,
according to the usual German
standard, will include twenty-seven long-range
guns and twenty smaller pieces for
repelling assaults on each of the main
forts. Thus on the nine forts there will
be altogether 414 guns. The seven intermediate
works will each mount ten of
the larger and eleven of the smaller guns:
altogether 154. In the central enceinte
there are understood to be 140 guns. If
the reserve is added we get an aggregate
of 1,000 guns, of which 60 per cent. are of
long range.</p>

<p>“The minimum infantry garrison of
Thorn is estimated at four battalions for
the forts and two for the central area.
The fortress is divided into four sections,
for each of which there must be a reserve
of three battalions. The artillery garrison,
reckoning eight men per gun, must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
be 8,000 strong, and there must be not
less than one battalion of engineers. The
total garrison cannot therefore be less
than 35,000 men.”</p>

<p>While preparations were being made
for the attack on the frontier fortresses,
the Tsar and Tsaritsa, accompanied by
their daughters the Grand-duchesses Olga
and Tatiana, took the highly popular step
of paying a visit to the garrison and
hospitals of the fortress of Ivangorod, so
recently the scene of such desperate
German attempts to break through on
this part of the line of the Vistula after
the smashing defeat of their rush for
Warsaw. The Imperial party came from
Lublin, and were received on arrival
by the Commandant of Ivangorod, the
Grand-duke Nicholas Michailovitch, and
by General Schwarz. The Tsar gave
public expression to the feeling of national<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
exhilaration in the following brief but
eloquent words: “With faith in the help
and blessing of the All-Highest, and in
the power of the mighty arms of united
Russia, our great country will conclude
no peace until the resistance of the enemy
has been finally broken, and the realisation
of the tasks bequeathed to us by our
ancestors has been accomplished.”</p>

<p>In Galicia more solid Russian successes
and a notable weakening in the power and
solidarity of the resistance marked the
growing pressure of the invaders of Austrian
territory. South of Przemysl, in one
day’s fighting early in November, a thousand
prisoners and some guns were taken.
Przemysl was quite cut off, though replying
energetically to a severe bombardment
by Dimitrieff’s siege-train. A sortie
was beaten back with much loss of
life. On the 10th Krasno was occupied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
forty miles west of the fortress, and on
the same day&mdash;a busy one in this particular
war-zone&mdash;the Austrians were driven
into the Carpathians after a further
defeat on the San which enabled their
relentless enemy to occupy Sanok and
Turka.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main invading army was
pressing on towards Cracow, with a view
to carrying on the siege of the place
simultaneously with the investment of
Przemysl. The occupation of Tarnow,
an important railway centre, brought
the Russians within forty-five miles of
Cracow on the east side, while the passage
of the river Schrenwaja from the Polish
frontier advanced them almost within
range of its guns.</p>

<p>In fact Cracow, defended by an Austro-German
garrison now estimated at
100,000 men, had been steadily preparing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
for the worst. A fire-zone with a radius of
eight miles had been cleared of all buildings,
and steel cupolas had been provided
for the main belt of its forts. On
the Raba, a stream which empties itself
into the Vistula twenty-five miles east
of the city, a series of field-works was
constructed, and the little town of Bochnia
was also fortified.</p>

<p>“You may be surprised,” wrote Mr.
Granville Fortescue in the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>,
“at the rapidity of the advance
on Cracow. It resulted from the precipitate
retirement of the German and
the Austrian forces through South-west
Poland. I am told that this withdrawal
was so rapid that the Russian pursuing
cavalry almost lost touch with their
foes. The enemy did not stop until he
was under the walls of Cracow. The
force which is to attack it from the north<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
had an almost free passage. Another
Russian force coming from Tarnow had
to fight for every inch of the ground occupied.
The Austrian force, which has
been retreating stubbornly along the
Rzeszow-Neu Sandec Railway, has given
considerable trouble.”</p>

<p>The same journal, commenting upon
the extraordinary extent of the battle-zone
and the probability of the final
fight for the Russo-Austro-German frontier
extending over weeks rather than
days, rightly remarked that the average
workaday intellect failed to grasp the
magnitude of the giant conflict in point
of mere numbers alone. It hazarded the
conjecture that over five hundred miles
of front three and a half millions of Russians
would be giving battle to a couple
of millions of Austrians and Germans!</p>

<p>A tide of refugees, estimated at not less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
than a hundred thousand in a few days,
was flying towards the city of Berlin from
the East Prussian and Silesian borders.
What a change from the “To Paris&mdash;to
London!” of a few weeks previously.
It was no longer practicable to conceal
from the mass of the people the news of
the total breakdown of the Polish invasion
and the Austrian debacle. Events would
still be slow-moving, since the mighty
military machine of All the Russians,
however well oiled, could only proceed
at a certain regulated pace. Reports
told of a new conception whereby the
Germans hoped, northwards of Thorn,
to concentrate masses of troops flanked
by the river Vistula on the one hand
and the river Warthe on the other.
Here they would have the advantage of
a battle-ground on a slightly raised platform
as compared with the marshy wildernesses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
of the recent Polish operations;
but the Masurian Lakes of East Prussia
were by this time in Russian hands. The
pace was quickening.</p>

<p>Mr. Fortescue, writing from Petrograd
in praise of the bearing and discipline of
the Tsar’s millions moving ever westward,
could not refrain from an expression
of his appreciation of the marked
improvement discernible after the lapse
of a decade in the Muscovite “Tommy
Atkins”:</p>

<p>“A draft of recruits, headed by a
band, passed through the square in front
of Saint Isaac’s Cathedral. I watched
critically. They wore their ordinary
clothes; the only uniforms seen were
those of the non-commissioned officers.
The astrakan cap was the distinctive
head-covering, and every other man
carried a tea-kettle. If I were a battalion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
commander I could not ask for a
better-looking batch of recruits. All
were over 5 ft. 6 in. in height. In carriage
and a certain indefinable air they reminded
me of the Guides from Manitoba.
The more I see of these troops the more
apparent the vast improvement of the
Russian forces since the Russo-Japanese
War becomes. That war was a liberal
education for this Army, and as teachers
of the art of war the Japanese are not to
be despised. It is curious to note how
this erstwhile enemy is now welcomed as
an Ally. Japanese flags are always prominent
in the colours of the nations
fighting Germany. At all public occasions
when the hymns of the different
nations are played the solemn notes of
the Japanese Anthem are loudly applauded.
In the cause of humanity it
may be said that Japan stands shoulder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
to shoulder with Russia. Russia need
fear no enemy in her rear while Japan
is her Ally.”</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the Russian
Army had been in many ways improved
since the war with Japan. The greatest
advance had been in the matter of the
working of the General Staff. The most
remarkable feature of this Polish campaign
was the methodical way in which
the huge armies engaged on the Russian
side had been concentrated and were now
moved and supplied in a difficult country
and on a front of many hundred miles.
It was evident that the Grand-duke
Nicholas and his subordinates were so
confident in the reorganised army that
they were even venturing to take very
serious risks. It is possible that they
did this with complete knowledge of the
peril they were incurring. It is remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
that at this stage of the campaign,
instead of concentrating their efforts
on any one point, they were using the
enormous numbers at their disposal to
operate in at least five different directions&mdash;in
East Prussia, on the Vistula
towards Thorn, in the centre towards
Posen, on the left centre by Lodz towards
Silesia, and on the left in Galicia. These
Galician operations were again being
carried on on three subordinate lines.
There was an attack on the line of the
Carpathians from Eastern Galicia menacing
Hungary, the siege of Przemysl,
and the advance on Cracow; and, besides
all this, subsequent events showed that
two additional armies were concentrated
in Southern Russia, in view of a possible
rupture with Turkey. One of these
armies was in the Caucasus, the other
was kept waiting about Odessa as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
reserve that might be used for a descent
upon the Turkish coasts. There were
further large garrisons kept about Petrograd,
and as a reserve for the Polish
campaign in the triangle of fortresses on
the Central Vistula.</p>

<p>This division of force between so many
different objectives certainly implied
some risk of the German and Austrian
Allies using their elaborately organised
railway system to concentrate a superior
force against some part of the far-extended
line. The risk was taken in order,
by menacing the whole of the eastern
frontiers of Germany, to create such a
state of alarm as would lead to German
troops being withdrawn from the western
theatre of war. There is evidence that
movements of this kind actually took
place, though perhaps not to the extent
that was reported in the French and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
English Press. The movements in the
end of October and during November
would seem to have been chiefly the
transfer by rail of cavalry divisions with
their batteries of artillery from west to
east. The war of entrenched positions
then in progress all along the western
front made mounted troops, comparatively
speaking, useless. They were therefore
sent eastward. Cavalry and horse artillery
require a large number of trains for
even a force of very moderate numbers,
and the movement of these trains would
easily give the impression that immense
numbers of men were being sent eastward.</p>

<p>In the second week of November there
were the first signs that the Germans,
instead of standing passively upon the
defensive, were once more venturing
upon a counter-attack based upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
eastern fortress line. This led to a
second invasion of Poland from Germany,
but its story belongs to a new phase of
the war. The first campaign in Poland
had closed with success for the Russian
arms all along the enormous frontier of
nearly fifteen hundred miles in length,
and after more than three months of war
there were no enemies on Russian territory.
The concentration of the armies
of the Tsar had been completed, and
the Grand-duke Nicholas had under his
command the greatest array of combatants
that had ever been assembled
by any State since the history of warfare
began.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
